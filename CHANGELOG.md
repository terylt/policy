## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Every verdict now reaches an audit sink, denials included.** An observation-only plugin runs as a post-hook, so it only ever saw traffic that was allowed through: a blocked call, an approval rejection, or a delegation failure produced no audit record at all. The executor now builds a `DecisionLog` recording what each plugin did and how the pipeline ruled, and hands it to any registered sink at the verdict itself rather than in a pipeline phase, so allow, deny, and modify all produce exactly one record. A hook resolving to zero plugins emits one allow record too, so a consumer counting records per invocation does not read "nothing configured" as a dropped record.

  A plugin becomes a sink by overriding `Plugin::as_audit_handler`. Sinks return `()`, so a sink can see a verdict but cannot influence it, and the decision log never reaches `PluginContext`, so an ordinary plugin cannot read what the sink reads. Sink calls are bounded by the plugin timeout with panics contained: a sink that fails is logged and skipped rather than taking down the request whose verdict is already decided.

  Opt-in and off by default. With no sink registered the executor builds the log but emits nothing, and the cost is a length check.

- **The reference `audit-logger` runs as a decision sink.** Listing no `hooks:` is no longer a configuration error: it selects sink mode, where the logger attaches to the verdict path and records the verdict and the ordered plugin actions alongside the fields it already emitted. Listing hooks keeps the previous per-hook observer, which continues to see only allowed traffic, so one instance never emits two records for one request.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-03

> **Upgrading from 0.1.0?** Configurations require changes: this release removes ten keys, changes the default dispatch mode, and tightens APL lexical rules. `docs/upgrade-apl.md` lists the required rewrites with before-and-after examples.
>
> `docs/apl-grammar.md` is the normative APL grammar, replacing the parser's inline grammar comments.

### Added

- **`assertions:` controls headers at trust boundaries.** Available alongside `authentication:` at global, default, bundle, and route scope, request assertions map engine-derived values such as `subject.id` and `claim.<name>` to upstream headers; response assertions strip or replace upstream headers. Target headers are removed before rendering, preventing a missing value from preserving client-supplied data under a trusted name.

  More-specific `headers:` entries replace matching targets, `strip:` entries accumulate, and `replace_inherited: true` resets inherited rules. Tokens and peer-supplied headers cannot be sources, while fixed protocol floors protect required request and response headers. Invalid or conflicting entries fail configuration loading with their location. Assertions run after the applicable policy phase and are unsigned, so recipients must trust the network path. See `docs/assertions.md`. ([#28](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/28))

- **`docs/apl-grammar.md` is now the normative APL grammar.** It documents the EBNF, lexical rules, precedence, valid syntax by position, YAML shape, dispatch-mode keys, and intentional quirks. Conformance tests keep the parser and document aligned with accepted and rejected cases for every production, documented quirk, and breaking change.

- **`response:`, the custom denial block, documented at last.** It shipped in 0.1.0 undocumented. A `response:` block on a route, a bundle, a `global.defaults.<entity>:` entry, or `global:` supplies the status and body a denial renders, and the most-specific layer wins on collision. `None` leaves the host's default denial behavior. Its resolution rule changed in this release too, which the Changed section covers.

- **Differential tests across Cedar, CEL, and OPA.** `ppe-pdp-diff` gives all three PDPs the same `AttributeBag` and equivalent policy intent, requiring agreement across their shared bool, int, string, and non-empty string-set subset. Documented semantic differences are allowlisted; any new disagreement, or a builtin PDP without a harness driver, fails the test suite. ([#25](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/25))

- **Delegated tokens can be cached until they expire.** The optional `cache:` block defaults to bounded-cardinality `this_workload` and `client` subjects; `user` and `caller_workload` require explicit opt-in through `cache.subjects`. Concurrent misses for one key share an exchange, failures are not cached, and `cache.ttl_ceiling_seconds` limits exposure to IdP-side revocation. ([#30](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/30))

- **A route that delegates an unvalidated credential is reported at config load.** A `delegate` step whose subject exchanges the caller's own token relies on identity resolution having checked it, but `identity:` is per-route and optional, so a route can reach the delegator with a token this process has not validated. Loading the config now warns under `alarm = "delegation_without_identity_resolution"`, naming the route and the delegate plugins on it. `subject: this_workload` is excluded, since it carries no inbound credential. ([#30](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/30))

- **`http.response` adds the return half of the L7 path.** A global `result:` or `post_invocation:` block now installs a post-phase handler for response-header and extension filtering; response bodies are not yet modeled. Hosts must explicitly fire the hook. Before doing so, review global post steps: previously inert HTTP steps become active, and `result.*` is absent for entity-less requests.

- **`http.status` exposes the response status to post-phase policy.** Hosts set the optional `u16` value on response invocation; it enters the attribute bag as an integer and uses the existing `read_headers` capability. The key is absent on requests, so status rules belong under `post_invocation:`. Unset values are omitted from serialized output. ([#40](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/40))

- **`http:` routes generic HTTP requests.** Bare paths and lists match exactly; maps support exact `path` or segment-boundary `path_prefix`, optionally narrowed by `method`. Exact paths outrank prefixes, longer prefixes outrank shorter ones, and narrower method sets win ties. Exact paths compare byte-for-byte, so `/admin` and `/admin/` are distinct. Unmatched requests use global policy, and a configuration without a catch-all is reported at load.

  HTTP routes require the default `dispatch: policy`. A policy body replaces the route's structural plugin chain, so listed plugins run only when policy steps name them. Route authentication also requires the host to provide the request line at the identity hook; otherwise global authentication applies and the engine warns. ([#40](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/40))

- **One declaration per hook, holding both its name and its routing metadata.** `define_hooks!` emits a hook's `pub const` and its `hooks::metadata` row together, so a name without a row is unrepresentable rather than something to test for. A host declaring its own hooks can use it too, then register the resulting slice at startup. `crates/ppe-core/examples/plugin_demo.rs` shows the pattern.

- **PPE performs no outbound HTTP of its own.** A host installs an `HttpTransport` and plugins borrow it, so a process embedding PPE keeps one connection pool, one TLS trust store, and one egress path instead of two. `identity-jwt`, `delegator-oauth`, and `elicitation-ciba` all go through it; `reqwest` is gone from the workspace entirely. A proxy injects its own client via `PolicyEngine::set_http_transport`; anyone embedding PPE standalone can call `install_default_http_transport` for a bundled hyper implementation behind the non-default `http-hyper` feature. ([#20](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/20))

- **`perform_http` capability.** Gates outbound HTTP, and gates the *action* rather than a slot — the first capability that authorizes reaching outside the process. Withholding it stops the call rather than degrading it, because a plugin that quietly skipped its `IdP` call would fail open. **Breaking for existing config**: a plugin using `jwks_url`, an OAuth delegator, or a CIBA approver must now declare it or the engine refuses to start, naming the plugin and the capability to add.

- **Response bodies are bounded.** Every outbound call now carries a size ceiling — 256 KiB for a JWKS document, 64 KiB for a token response — so a compromised or broken endpoint cannot stream until the process dies. `reqwest` applied no limit on any of these paths, so this closes a gap rather than tightening a bound.

- **HTTP/2, where the peer supports it.** The bundled transport advertises ALPN `h2, http/1.1` and falls back to HTTP/1.1, which the previous `reqwest` configuration never enabled. A deployment minting a token per request carries those concurrently over one connection instead of one connection each.

- **Retries are keyed to whether a repeat is safe.** `RetryPolicy` distinguishes an operation that can be repeated from one that cannot, and `HttpTransportError::may_have_reached_peer` answers the question a caller actually needs. A JWKS `GET` retries freely; a token exchange and a CIBA dispatch retry only failures that provably never reached the peer, because a timeout cannot tell "never arrived" from "the reply was lost" and repeating either would mint a second credential or ask a human twice.

- **`delegation.egress_denied` / `elicitation.egress_denied`.** New deny codes for the case where the host refuses a call before it leaves the process — an egress policy, an SSRF guard, an open circuit. Kept distinct from `idp_unreachable` on purpose: "we declined to try" and "we tried and failed" send an operator to different places, and collapsing them turns a blocked destination into a phantom network problem. The bundled hyper transport produces the refusal for destinations in the shared address table.

- **A shared table of addresses an outbound call must not reach.** `praxis_policy_core::http_addr` covers loopback, RFC 1918, link-local (the cloud-metadata range), CGNAT `100.64/10`, the IPv6 equivalents, and the embedded-IPv4 forms including NAT64. The table only; `praxis-policy-core` opens no sockets, so a transport enforces it where it dials. Sharing it stops three transports each writing a range list that drifts, and these are exactly the ranges that look finished while missing an entry.

- **`FakeTransport` for tests.** A scripted transport in `praxis-policy-core::http_testing`, which makes the paths a mock server cannot reach — a timeout, a connect failure, a rotation between two fetches — assertable without sleeping.

- **Claim mapping is configuration.** The JWT identity plugin's `claim_mapper` names any of four shipped presets (`standard`, `keycloak`, `auth0`, `cognito`), and a new `claim_map` field takes a map written inline, so an `IdP` that nests roles under `realm_access.roles` or namespaces them behind a URL no longer needs a patched crate. A field lists candidate paths tried in order, with options for shape, splitting, and whether a miss refuses the token, and `merge: union` takes every candidate that resolves, each value once, in first-seen order. Paths use dots for nesting, with `\.` for a literal dot. An existing config is unaffected: naming no mapper resolves to `standard`, which the tests hold to the previous Rust mapper. ([#31](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/pull/31))

- **A policy can gate on which `IdP` minted a token.** `claims: {include: [iss]}` returns a claim to the policy-visible bag, registered claims included, so `claim.iss` becomes readable. Registered claims were always dropped, so a deployment trusting several issuers could not gate on which one signed the token. `claims.exclude` drops a claim the other way, and both work with a preset or an inline map. Both lists take top-level claim names, since the bag is keyed by name: a dotted entry is refused at load rather than matching nothing, and a claim whose own name holds a dot is written with `\.`. A `role: caller_workload` resolver carries no claims bag, and says so at load rather than ignoring the setting quietly. ([#31](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/pull/31))

- **Each shipped preset records what it omits.** Auth0 and Keycloak put their roles claim where no preset can name it, so those need a hand-written `claim_map`. Presets leave a field empty rather than filling it with the wrong concept, because Keycloak's `groups` holds realm roles and Cognito's `cognito:roles` holds IAM role ARNs. Each preset's description says what it covers and what is opt-in at the provider. ([#31](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/pull/31))

- **Roles and permissions are readable as whole sets.** `subject.roles`, `subject.permissions`, `client.roles`, and `client.permissions` join `subject.teams` as `StringSet` bag keys, so a policy can write `"hr" in subject.roles` rather than enumerating `role.<name>` booleans. The flattened boolean keys are unchanged. ([#7](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/pull/7))

### Changed

- **`require(P)` is now a predicate meaning `!P`.** It accepts general predicates, including comparisons, negation, and composition with `&` or `|`. Existing accepted forms retain their semantics: `require(a)`, `require(a, b)`, and `require(a | b)` still normalize to the same trees.

  Commas bind lower than `&` and `|`, so previously rejected mixtures such as `require(a, b | c)` now parse as `!(a & (b | c))`; review any such configuration before upgrading. A top-level `require(...)` rule may only `deny`, while `require` nested inside a larger predicate remains ordinary negation.

- **A field operation in rule position is rejected.** `result.ssn | redact` where a rule belongs used to compile as a disjunction of two truthy attributes and take the default deny, so a chain one position too high enforced something its author never asked for. It now fails the load, naming the position and pointing at `args:` and `result:`. This is a property of the rule shape too, so it holds in all three spellings. A legal disjunction of two attribute paths (`result.x | result.y`) is untouched: what marks a field operation is a field head with a stage beside it, not a `|`.

- **`run(name)` is the only form that invokes a plugin.** `plugin(name)` was a second spelling for it in both step and stage position, so a reader had to know both and a document could use either. It is refused in both positions now, naming `run(name)`. The word survives as a noun: `plugin:` as a keyword argument inside `delegate(...)`, and the `delegate:` map form, both still parse.

- **An empty stage in a pipe chain is rejected.** A leading, trailing or doubled `|` left a position with no stage in it, and those positions were skipped, so a chain compiled shorter than its author wrote it. `parse_pipeline("")` still answers with an empty pipeline, because a caller hands it a field value that may be absent and absent is not malformed; what is refused is naming a stage and then leaving a position beside it empty.

  The `validate(name)` refusal now names `run(...)` rather than the removed spelling among its alternatives.

- **One rule for a quoted literal, and escapes that unescape.** Quoted text was read in ten places with three different escape rules and two different answers for an unterminated quote. The lexer processed no escapes at all, so there was no way to write a quote inside a literal delimited by that quote; the delegate-argument splitter let a backslash protect the next character; the pipe finder skipped two bytes after one. Two splitters treated an unterminated quote as an error and two silently swallowed the rest of the line, which is how a rule could lose its action with no diagnostic. Every site now reads a literal the same way.

  The escape set is exactly `\\`, `\'`, and `\"`. **Breaking for policy text that carries a backslash**, and this is the one change in the release that can break text which looks correct: a backslash used to pass through untouched, so a regex character class worked by accident. Write `regex("\\d+")` where you wrote `regex("\d+")`; the single form now fails the load naming the unrecognized escape rather than being reinterpreted. `\n` and `\t` are deliberately not escapes: a deny reason rides in a violation field a host renders, so a multi-line reason there is a display problem rather than a capability.

  Two things that were quietly wrong are now right. A closing paren inside a literal is content, so `deny("blocked (see policy)")` loads where it used to be refused as a malformed call. And a lone quote in a field stage is an unterminated literal, where `regex(")` used to compile to a pattern matching one quote character. A stage argument may still carry no quotes at all, so `enum(low, medium, high)` and `regex(^[A-Z]+$)` are unaffected.

- **An attribute path is a production, so a path that names nothing fails the load.** `a..b`, `a.`, `.a`, `data.t[]`, `data.t[a:b]`, and `data.t["a]"]` all lexed clean and then resolved to an absent attribute, which made a predicate silently false and a `require` silently deny: a policy that never matched and never said why. Each is now rejected naming the production it broke. A quoted key inside a subscript was the quiet one, since `data.t["a"]` looked up the four characters `"a"` including the quotes and so never matched anything; write `data.t[subject.tenant]` with the inner path unquoted.

  The rule splitter counts brackets now, which its two siblings already did. A colon inside a subscript used to be the only depth-zero colon on a bare-predicate line, so the rule split into a predicate and a nonsense action and the error named neither brackets nor quotes.

- **`not` is reserved, and a doubled boolean operator names the single form.** `not authenticated` used to read as an attribute called `not` followed by a stray token, so the error mentioned neither `not` nor `!`. It now names `!`. The `not in` phrase is unaffected, and it is the one place the word is legal; a path beginning `not.` is rejected too, which used to slip through because the keyword table compared the whole path. `a && b` and `a || b` name `&` and `|` instead of dumping a token. Spacing around an operator is not significant and never was, despite a comment in the lexer claiming a caller enforced it.

- **A number has one shape, and a position is a character offset.** Digits are required on both sides of the dot, so `1.` is rejected; `.5` was already rejected while `-.5` parsed as a float, and both now name the number. An exponent is rejected by name rather than producing a trailing-token error that never mentioned it. `007` is still the integer 7, deliberately: reading it as octal would alter a value silently.

  Lexer positions count characters rather than bytes, and name the real character. A non-ASCII identifier was reported at a byte index, and the character was rendered by casting a single byte to `char`, so the message named a character that was not in the input at all.

- **`engine_settings.dispatch:` defaults to `policy`.** It defaulted to `hooks`, where every declared plugin fires at every hook its own `hooks:` names. The document a policy engine is written in is the `routes:` / `groups:` / `global:` half, and defaulting to the other one meant the common config was the one whose policy did nothing until an operator found the key naming the mode. A config carrying `routes:`, `groups:`, or `global:` now needs no `engine_settings:` block at all.

  **Breaking for existing config**, and the widest break in this release. A config that declared plugins and relied on the old default fired all of them; under `policy` a plugin runs only where a step names it. `dispatch: hooks` restores the old behavior exactly and is the one-line upgrade for a config that wants it. Two checks make the difference visible rather than silent, below.

- **A declared plugin no policy reaches fails the load, by name.** Under `dispatch: policy` a plugin runs only from a step that names it, so a plugin nothing names is inert and every request it was meant to govern is ungoverned. The load now fails, naming each unreached plugin. The reference set is wider than a `run(name)` step: an `authentication:` list at any scope, a `delegate` call, and an elicitation verb's handler each reach a plugin, and a step under `global.authorization:` reaches one for every route it stacks onto. The check is per plugin rather than per config, so a config naming one of three still reports the other two. A host that registers no orchestrator gets a narrower version from the engine itself: policy mode, plugins declared, and no `routes:`, `groups:`, or `global:` block to name them from.

- **A plugin reached on fewer hooks than it declares is reported at load.** A plugin declaring three hooks and named by a step on one runs on that one, where hook dispatch ran it on three. Narrowing is often what an operator meant, so it warns rather than failing, under `alarm = "plugin_narrowed_by_policy"`, naming the plugin and every hook left uncovered. Add a step on the uncovered hooks, or narrow the plugin's own `hooks:` to match what the policy asks for.

- **A request the engine cannot identify is denied rather than dispatched against absent context.** A request carrying no `meta.entity_type` / `meta.entity_name` resolves no route, and it used to fall through to every entry registered on the hook. In the mode whose premise is that a policy decides, that both ran plugins against context which was not there and let a caller skip every rule by omitting metadata. It is now denied with the violation code `unidentified_request` and a 400-class proto code, distinct from a policy's own deny because no rule was reached. **The guard is the configuration, not the mode**: a config declaring no policy at all passes the request exactly as before, so a deployment that has not written policy yet sees no new denials. An HTTP request is unaffected either way, since it names its entity type and resolves the global annotation.

- **The compiled IR stops speaking a vocabulary no config may use.** `Phase::Policy` and `Phase::PostPolicy` are `Phase::PreInvocation` and `Phase::PostInvocation`; `CompiledRoute.policy` and `.post_policy` are `.pre_invocation` and `.post_invocation`. The three config structs whose Rust field was `identity` behind `#[serde(rename = "authentication")]` now name the field `authentication`, matching the key a document writes. `CompiledRoute.args` and `.result` were already right and did not move.

  The old spellings were the config keys this release removes, so the IR was the last place naming a form a document is now rejected for writing. **Breaking** for Rust callers reading those fields or matching those variants. `Phase` and `CompiledRoute` both derive `Serialize`, so the **serialized keys change too**: a phase serializes as `pre_invocation` / `post_invocation` rather than `policy` / `post_policy`, and a serialized `CompiledRoute` names the two step lists the same way. A consumer reading either shape off the wire has to move with it. The `authentication` rename is Rust-only, since the serde key was already `authentication`.

- **A plugin only an unreachable layer names fails the reachability check.** The per-plugin check tallied a layer's references as soon as the layer compiled, which treated every compiled layer as executable. A group installs no handler and matches no request on its own, and an entity default only stacks onto routes of its type, so a plugin named in a group nothing joins, or in a default for an entity type no route declares, has no dispatch path and reported as reachable anyway. The tally now comes from the effective route, at the point a handler installs, so it counts the layers a route actually inherits.

  `global:` keeps its exception, and it is the only one: it installs the entity-less HTTP catch-all, which governs every request that resolves no route, so a config with no `routes:` at all still reaches its plugins.

  **Breaking for existing config**: a document that declares a group or an entity default no route reaches now fails the load naming the plugin, where it used to load with that policy dead. Join the group from a route, or drop it.

- **A route joining a group through `groups:` inherits that group's `authorization:`.** `groups: hr` and `meta: { tags: [hr] }` are documented as resolving identically, and they did not. Identity resolution read both spellings; the orchestrator that layers a bundle's policy read `meta.tags` alone, so a `groups:` membership inherited the group's `authentication:` and none of its `authorization:`.

  With the activation lists gone, authorization layering is most of what a group is for, so this was a fail-open rather than a metadata asymmetry: no layer contributed anything to the route, so no handler installed and the route was governed by nothing at all. Both chains now read one ordered stream of membership names, `meta.tags` in declaration order then `groups:`, which is also what makes `replace_inherited:` well defined at bundle scope. A name written in both spellings is one membership, so the group's steps run once.

  **Breaking for existing config**: a route joining a group through `groups:` begins enforcing that group's `authorization:`. If you were relying on the old asymmetry, that route will start denying what the group denies. Move the route out of the group, or move the policy off the group, whichever you meant.

- **A policy term with no visitor to compile it fails the load.** `authorization:`, `args:`, `result:`, `response:`, and the `global:` wiring keys are accepted at every section that can carry them, and their bodies live only in the raw document: the typed config model has no field for any of them, because the APL runtime's config visitor is what reads them. With no visitor registered the load committed the typed config and returned success having dropped every one, so a route declaring `authorization: [run(audit)]`, or an unconditional `deny`, loaded clean, installed no handler, and enforced nothing at all. The load now names the section, the keys, and the two ways out: register the visitor (`praxis_policy_apl_runtime::register_apl`), or write `dispatch: hooks`.

  The reachability backstop did not cover this and could not. It passes as soon as a document declares any route, group, default, or global authentication block, which the document in question does.

  The check runs before the typed config is installed, so a rejected document never becomes the live snapshot. It reads the key model rather than a written list, so a policy term added later cannot slip past it. `parse_config` is untouched: it parses and validates a document without loading it, and a host may well parse one for an engine that does have a visitor.

- **The two dispatch modes reject each other's keys by name.** Each used to ignore the other's silently, which is how a config asked for one mode's behavior and got the other's. Under `engine_settings.dispatch: hooks`, `routes:`, `groups:`, `global:`, and `global.defaults:` are load errors: hook dispatch resolves none of them, so a route written there matched nothing and reported nothing. Under `dispatch: policy`, a per-plugin `conditions:` is a load error: a policy decides dispatch, so the condition was never consulted. The error names the key and the mode that rejects it.

  A per-plugin `priority:` is a load error there too, for the same reason. It orders the entries one hook holds, and policy dispatch never runs more than one at a time: effects run in the order the document writes them, a `run(name)` step invokes the single plugin it names, and the runtime hands the executor a one-entry slice. Identity resolution is declaration order and reads no priority either. The key was accepted and inert, which is the ambiguity this release set out to remove. Order the steps under `authorization:` instead, or write `dispatch: hooks` to order by priority.

  Both checks read the document, so only a *declared* key is refused. The typed `PolicyConfig` boundary refuses the activation lists, `conditions:`, and the hook-mode scopes, but not `priority:`: the field is defaulted, so a host that set the default cannot be told apart from one that set nothing.

  **Breaking for existing config**: the mode is checked against the effective value, written or defaulted. A config declaring `routes:`, `groups:`, or `global:` needs nothing written, since `policy` is the default. One that declares plugins with their own `conditions:` or `priority:`, or relies on every declared plugin firing at the hooks it names, must write `dispatch: hooks`.

- **A tag bundle's `authentication.replace_inherited: true` is honored.** It now removes global authentication and earlier bundles from each affected route; later bundles and route-level authentication still append. Bundle order is `meta.tags` followed by `groups:`, each in declaration order. **Breaking for existing config**: routes inheriting this flag may authenticate with fewer steps. The `authentication_replaced_above_the_route` alarm identifies each route, the replacing section, and the removed steps.

- **`attribute_files:`, `pdp:`, and `session_store:` are `global:` keys, and nowhere else.** `attribute_files:` was read only as `global.apl.attribute_files`, so it moves with the wrapper: write it as `global.attribute_files:`. `pdp:` and `session_store:` were accepted on a route, under `global.defaults.<entity>:`, and on a bundle, where the compiler dropped them and the load warned; they now fail the load naming the key. A PDP, the session store, and the static attribute tree are process-global, so the three engine blocks agree on their own scope for the first time. The diagnostic paths follow: an error that said `global.apl.attribute_files` now says `global.attribute_files`.

- **A key nothing reads now fails the load at every scope, not only on a route.** `GlobalConfig` and `PolicyGroup` drop an unknown field, so a misspelled `authorizaton:` under `global:`, `global.defaults.<entity>:`, or a bundle used to load clean and enforce nothing. Each of those scopes now reports every unrecognized key it carries, naming the section, the same way a route already did. A visitor's `extra_route_keys` are honored at those scopes too, so an out-of-tree orchestrator's own block stays loadable wherever it is written.

- **A `response:` block resolves by one rule.** It was read from the section and, failing that, from inside `apl:`, with the section winning — the inverse of the precedence the wrapper itself had. With no wrapper there is one source: the section. A `response:` nested inside anything is an unknown key.

- **`HookFamily::for_entity` reports an unmapped entity type instead of defaulting to CMF.** It returned `HookFamily` and treated every entity type other than `http` as the CMF family, so a route on an entity type nobody had mapped yet would install a handler that reports the CMF family and hands its plugins a chat message no host filled. The `else` also hid the omission from the compiler: the closed matches elsewhere in the crate flagged a new family, this function did not. It now returns `Option<HookFamily>` over the same entity types `hook_pair_for_entity` maps, and the visitor's install path logs and skips an unmapped one, which is what it already does for an entity type with no hook pair. **Breaking** for a caller that used the returned family directly; the fix is to handle `None` rather than assume CMF.

- **`HookFamily` is `#[non_exhaustive]` and `hook_type_name` is public.** The enum was public and exhaustive, so a third payload family would have been a breaking change for every downstream `match` on it, and its only interesting method was private, so a host could hold one and not ask it anything. `#[non_exhaustive]` is itself **breaking** for a downstream exhaustive `match`, which is the argument for doing it while the enum has two variants rather than at the moment a third one lands.

- **Generic HTTP has its own `http.request` and `http.response` hook family.** `HttpHook` and `HttpPayload` replace the misleading CMF message payload; handlers read exchange data from `HttpExtension`. **Breaking for existing config**: rename `cmf.http_request` and `cmf.http_response`. Rust callers likewise replace `HOOK_CMF_HTTP_REQUEST` / `HOOK_CMF_HTTP_RESPONSE` with `praxis_policy_core::http_hook::{HOOK_HTTP_REQUEST, HOOK_HTTP_RESPONSE}`. ([#40](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/40))

- **Plugins on HTTP routes receive `HttpPayload`.** **Breaking for hosts firing HTTP hooks**: use `invoke_named::<HttpHook>("http.request", HttpPayload, ...)`, and implement `HookHandler<HttpHook>` for HTTP plugins. MCP and A2A routes continue to use `CmfHook` and `MessagePayload`; handlers distinguish HTTP responses by the presence of `http.status`. ([#40](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/40))

- **Registration refuses handlers with incompatible hook payloads.** Hook metadata now records its payload family, and registration fails atomically when a handler reports a different family. Family-less and `HookMetadata::permissive()` rows remain open to any handler; route annotations are unchanged. **Breaking for Rust callers**: `HookMetadata` gains a third field, and `define_hooks!` rows accept an optional `family:` hook type. ([#40](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/40))

- **An `args:` or `result:` block on an `http:` route is refused at load.** A field stage addresses a path inside a message, and a generic HTTP request carries none, so such a stage would read nothing and rewrite nothing. The load now fails naming the declaration and the block, and points at `pre_invocation:` / `post_invocation:` with the `http.*` attributes instead. It covers both scopes that reach HTTP routes and nothing else: a route's own policy block and `global.defaults.http`. A `global:` block carrying `args:` still loads, because those stages are meaningful for the entity routes the global layer also stacks onto. ([#40](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/40))

- **Declared hook names are validated at config load.** Unknown or inert `hooks:` entries now fail with the plugin name and, when useful, the nearest registered hook. **Breaking for existing config** containing such names. Hosts must register custom hook metadata before loading any configuration that references it; the registry is process-wide and shared by all `PolicyEngine` instances.

- **Both route resolvers take the route already matched.** `resolve_plugins_for_entity` and `resolve_identity_plugins_for_route` receive the matched route instead of matching a second time, and the identity resolver no longer takes an entity type, because a matched route carries the one it matched under. The engine used to match once for the annotation lookup and again inside each resolver on every cache miss; matching once is also what lets the name a request resolved to be the only key the annotation table and the route cache ever see, so a request path never becomes a cache key. The layering each resolver does (global, entity-type default, group and tag bundles, then the route) is unchanged. **Breaking** for Rust callers, of which there were none outside this repository's engine; no configuration resolves differently. ([#40](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/40))

- **`annotate_route` reports whether it replaced a handler.** The annotation table was a plain insert, so a second handler at the same `(entity_type, entity_name, scope, hook_name)` dropped the first with nothing recording that either existed. It now returns whether it replaced one, and the APL visitor warns naming the coordinates. The later handler still wins, since a host may replace deliberately. **Breaking** for a Rust caller that binds the return type; ignoring the value compiles unchanged. ([#40](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/40))

- **Path normalization and route-resolution errors are public.** `normalize_match_path` removes query, fragment, and path parameters; collapses duplicate slashes; and resolves literal or encoded dot segments without decoding separators. Route matching and policy still use the host-supplied path; normalization only validates readability. With any `http:` route configured, unreadable paths are denied with `unreadable_request_path` and status 400. ([#40](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/40))

- **A route key nothing reads fails at load, naming the key and the route.** `RouteEntry` ignores unknown fields, so a misspelled selector left a route matching nothing and a stale key sat there looking effective. A raw-YAML scan now refuses a route key nothing consumes, and `ConfigVisitor` gained a method reporting the extra route keys its visitor reads, so an orchestrator's own block stays loadable. `deny_unknown_fields` cannot do this job: a route mapping legitimately carries `apl:`, `response:`, and the flat APL terms the visitor accepts alongside the keys the typed struct models. **Breaking** where a route carries a key nothing consumes, which was inert before and is a typo either way. A host whose visitor reads route keys of its own must load through `load_config_yaml`: `parse_config` and `load_config(path)` register no visitor, so they scan with the built-in list alone. ([#40](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/40))

- **Config validation runs on every load path.** `PolicyEngine::load_config` and `from_config` take a pre-built `PolicyConfig` and ran neither `validate_config` nor the top-level `groups:` merge, so a host building its config in Rust got no duplicate-plugin-name check, no route-shape check, and no group resolution — routes silently lost the plugins and `authentication:` their group was meant to supply. Both now normalize and validate the way the YAML paths do. **Breaking**: a programmatic config with a duplicate plugin name, a malformed route, an unknown hook name, or a route naming a plugin absent from `plugins:` now fails where it previously loaded with the offending piece inert. That last case reaches a host that registers handlers with `register_handler` instead of declaring them under `plugins:` and then names them in a route.

- **`hooks::metadata::lookup` returns `Option<HookMetadata>`.** It used to substitute a wildcard for a name the registry did not hold, so an absent hook and a deliberately unphased one both read as `Unphased` and a caller reading phase could not tell a missing entry from a real one. `HookMetadata::unknown()` is renamed `permissive()` to match: the wildcard is now a default a caller opts into, not the shape of a failed lookup. **Breaking** for Rust callers; `lookup(name).unwrap_or_else(HookMetadata::permissive)` restores the old behavior exactly.

- **`Plugin::initialize_with` is what the engine calls.** It receives the host services the plugin's capabilities allow, and its default forwards to `initialize`, so a plugin needing nothing from the host is untouched. Override exactly one: the default body of `initialize_with` is what calls `initialize`, so overriding it replaces that call.

- **`identity-jwt` refreshes JWKS on demand instead of on a timer**, and `min_refresh_interval_secs` (default 30) is a new knob bounding how often one issuer may re-fetch. `refresh_secs` keeps its meaning as the staleness bound. See the fix below for why the timer went.

- **Unknown keys in the JWT plugin's config are rejected.** The resolver config and each `trusted_issuers` entry default every field, so a misspelling took effect silently, and a misspelled `audiences` turned audience checking off. **Breaking** for a config carrying a key the plugin does not read. ([#31](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/pull/31))

- **A SPIFFE ID with no trust domain is refused.** `spiffe:///ns/default/sa/agent` carries the scheme but no authority, so it named no trust boundary and the mapper still filed it as a workload identity whose trust domain was the empty string. It now declines, the same as any other non-SPIFFE subject, and a valid candidate behind it still resolves. **Breaking** for a deployment minting such a token, which was never a valid SPIFFE ID. ([#31](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/pull/31))

- **A workload's trust domain is no longer mappable.** It is the authority of the SPIFFE ID, so it is derived from the identity rather than read from a claim. ([#31](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/pull/31))

- **Unused items fail the build.** `dead_code` is denied workspace-wide, so a function with no caller is a compile error rather than something coverage work has to find by hand. Public host-facing API with no in-tree caller stays, marked with a reason naming who calls it from outside. ([#13](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/13))

### Security

- **A panicking `parallel:` branch is a Deny.** Dropping it let a sibling Allow stand in for a gate that never finished, the same fail-open shape as pairing a Deny with Aborted. The Deny reason says fail-closed and names the panic. ([#16](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/16))

- **The bundled hyper transport enforces the shared address table.** Loopback, RFC 1918, link-local (including cloud metadata), and CGNAT are refused at the address that would be dialled, including IP literals that never hit DNS and hostnames that resolve only to those addresses. The refusal is `HttpTransportError::Rejected` (not a connect failure), so a token-endpoint hostname on `10.x` reports `delegation.egress_denied` rather than `idp_unreachable` and is not retried. `with_allow_private_destinations` is the hatch for a local `IdP`. ([#16](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/16))

- **Leg-2 token-exchange denials no longer forward `error_description` or the raw body.** Leg 1 already dropped those because an `IdP` may echo the submitted credential; leg 2 submits the caller's bearer as `subject_token` and had the same leak. The violation now carries the OAuth `error` code or the HTTP status. ([#16](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/16))

- **An omitted JWT `audiences` list is refused at load.** An empty list used to disable `aud` checking, so a token minted for another app was accepted if the signature and issuer matched. A configured list also requires the token to carry an `aud` claim; omitting the claim used to pass. The hatch is `skip_audience_validation: true`, which still accepts any `aud` or none. **Breaking** for a config that listed no audiences. ([#16](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/16))

- **`!=` on a missing attribute is true.** `subject.role != "admin": deny` did not fire when `role` was absent, because every missing comparison returned false, including `NotEq` — so it did not match `!(subject.role == "admin")` and an unauthenticated request fell through to Allow. ([#16](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/16))

- **A non-numeric or non-finite amount fails an order comparison closed.** `"NaN"`, `"Infinity"`, and `"lots"` made `args.amount > 10000: deny` Allow, because a failed comparison was `false` and skipped the rule. IEEE is the same trap for `NaN` and `-inf`; `inf > 10000` is true, so classifying non-finite as non-numeric also stopped `"Infinity"` from matching. The phase now Denies, and `!` cannot invert that into Allow. Mixed int/float order on an integer whose magnitude exceeds 2^53 is the same Deny — including a string-encoded amount — because coercing through `f64` would collapse distinct values and skip a max-amount rule. ([#16](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/16))

- **A handler result that cannot be read is an execution error.** Downcast failure used to be treated as Allow in both the serial and concurrent executors, so a deny the framework could not decode was dropped. `on_error: fail` now halts. ([#16](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/16))

### Removed

- **`compile_config` and its incompatible `routes:` map shape.** `ConfigYaml`, `CompiledConfig`, and private `compile_route` are also removed; production already uses the list-based route shape and `compile_policy_block_value`. **Breaking for Rust callers**: tests can use `test_util::compile_test_policy` behind `praxis-policy-apl-core`'s `test-util` feature. Empty policy blocks now compile to empty routes, detectable through `declared_phases().is_empty()`. Coverage now includes all features.

- **Policy-mode plugin activation lists.** Route, bundle, entity-default, and reserved `all` bundle `plugins:` lists are now load errors under `dispatch: policy`; invoke plugins with `run(name)` instead. Empty lists are also rejected. Plugin override mappings and top-level declarations remain valid.

  **Breaking for existing config.** What replaces chain-wide activation is a `run(name)` step under `global.authorization`, which stacks onto every entity route, so a config using the `all` bundle migrates like this:

  ```yaml
  # Before
  groups:
    all:
      plugins: [audit-log]

  # After
  global:
    authorization:
      pre_invocation:
        - "run(audit-log)"
  ```

  Bundle and route lists move into their own `authorization:` blocks. Use `dispatch: hooks` when a plugin must fire at a hook no APL block annotates.

- **The `http:` route inertness report.** A load reported that `http:` routes existed while `engine_settings.dispatch` was `hooks`. `routes:` is a load error in that mode now, so a config carrying an `http:` route is in policy mode by construction and the report had no reachable input. The report beside it, that a set of `http:` routes declares no catch-all, stays.

- **A route's `when:`.** The expression was never evaluated, although its specificity bonus could make that route win a tie. **Breaking for existing config**: move the condition to a `when:` / `do:` authorization step. Formerly tied routes now resolve by declaration order, so review any pair that relied on the removed bonus.

- **`plugin_dirs:`, `engine_settings.parallel_execution_within_band`, `engine_settings.fail_on_plugin_error`, and authentication-step `on_error:`.** These parsed but inert keys now fail at load. Replace them respectively with `register_factory()` plus a `plugins:` declaration, plugin-level `mode: concurrent`, plugin-level `on_error: fail`, and the referenced plugin's `on_error:` setting. Engine settings and map-form authentication steps now reject unknown keys.

  **Breaking for embedders**: `PolicyConfig::plugin_dirs`, `EngineSettings::parallel_execution_within_band`, `EngineSettings::fail_on_plugin_error`, `RouteEntry::when`, `ResolvedPlugin::when`, `RouteIdentityStep::on_error`, and `RouteIdentityStep::extra` are all removed from `praxis-policy-core`.

- **`policy:`, `post_policy:`, `identity:`, and `global.policies:`.** **Breaking for existing config**: use `authorization.pre_invocation`, `authorization.post_invocation`, `authentication:`, and top-level `groups:` respectively. Removed keys now fail as unknown with their replacement, and `groups:` is the only bundle declaration location.

  **Breaking for embedders**: the rename tables and the errors that existed only to report these keys are gone with them. `config::RENAMED_APL_KEYS` and `config::renamed_apl_key_message` are removed from `praxis-policy-core`, and `ParseError::RenamedField` is removed from `praxis-policy-apl-core`; a removed key now arrives as the same unknown-key error every other bad key gets. `GlobalConfig::policies` is renamed to `GlobalConfig::bundles` and is no longer a serde field, since top-level `groups:` is what fills it.

- **Every top-level key the document model does not name.** `engine_settings:`, `global:`, `groups:`, `routes:`, and `plugins:` are the whole set, and anything else fails the load. This closes the last silent drop: a config still writing `plugin_settings:` lost every engine setting including `dispatch:`, so it ran in the default mode rather than the one it declared. The targeted rejection that shipped with the rename is now the general rule, and it still names `engine_settings` and the `dispatch: policy` spelling that replaced `routing_enabled: true`.

- **The route shape's catch-all in the policy compiler.** A route handed to the standalone compile entry point accepted any key and stashed the ones it did not model, so a flat `pre_invocation:` compiled a route with no policy in it. The shape now denies unknown fields: `authorization:`, `args:`, `result:`, and `plugins:` are the whole body, and anything else fails to compile. The config-load path already refused these through its key tables; this closes the same gap for a caller that compiles a document directly.

- **Flat `pre_invocation:` / `post_invocation:` keys.** **Breaking for existing config**: nest phase lists under `authorization:` at every scope, for example `authorization: { pre_invocation: [...] }`. Empty authorization blocks are rejected. `args:` and `result:` remain directly on the section. This changes the 0.1.0 policy-document compatibility guarantee; plugin kinds, route and plugin names, hook names, and violation codes remain stable.

- **`args:` and `result:` under `global:`.** A field pipeline names one field of the payload a route carries, and `global:` covers every entity route at once rather than reaching a payload of its own. The two blocks are no longer keys there and each fails the load naming itself. This is a **removed capability, not a tightening**: it was the only spelling for one field pipeline covering every entity route, and there is no replacement that keeps that reach. Write the pipeline on each `global.defaults.<entity>:` block that has a payload for it to address, or on the routes themselves. Both blocks are unchanged at every other scope.

- **The `apl:` wrapper.** A section's policy terms were accepted twice, nested under `apl:` or written directly on the section, and the two spellings needed two precedence rules that pointed opposite ways: the wrapper won outright for the policy terms, while the section won for `response:`. The wrapper is gone at every scope — `global:`, `global.defaults.<entity>:`, `groups.<name>:`, and a `routes[]` entry — and a config still writing one fails the load naming the key rather than dropping the policy inside it. **Breaking for existing config**: lift each `apl:` block's contents onto the section that carried it. `apl: { authorization: {...} }` becomes `authorization: {...}`, `apl: { pdp: [...] }` under `global:` becomes `pdp: [...]`, and `global.apl.attribute_files` becomes `global.attribute_files`.

- **The unused `hooks::types::hook_names` and `hooks::types::cmf_hook_names` modules.** **Breaking for Rust callers**: import CMF names from `praxis_policy_core::cmf::constants`, alongside `identity::HOOK_IDENTITY_RESOLVE`, `delegation::HOOK_TOKEN_DELEGATE`, and `elicitation::HOOK_ELICIT`. Their operator-facing string values remain stable.

- **`AplRouteHandler::with_pdp_router` is gone.** Install a `PdpRouter` through `with_pdp`, which is what the visitor already does. ([#13](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/13))

### Fixed

- **Delegators and elicitation handlers are no longer reported as narrowed when their family-specific hooks are reached.** `delegate(...)` is credited to `token.delegate`, and elicitation verbs to `elicit`. Unreached hooks declared by those plugins are still reported.

- **The bundled hyper transport selects `ring` explicitly.** It no longer depends on rustls's process default, which is ambiguous when a host includes both `ring` and `aws-lc-rs`. It neither reads nor installs that default, and TLS setup errors now return `HttpTransportError::Connect` instead of panicking.

- **Glob routes under `tool:`, `resource:`, `prompt:`, and `llm:` now evaluate their policy bodies.** Annotation lookup now resolves a request name to the configured pattern. Exact selectors still outrank globs, including when the exact route has no policy body.

- **A bundle joined through both `meta.tags` and `groups:` no longer runs its `authentication:` steps twice.** Bundle membership is now deduplicated before authentication and assertion layers are resolved, keeping their inheritance order consistent.

- **A `delegate(...)` or elicitation step above route scope no longer fails reachability checks.** Global, entity-default, and group layers now count delegation and elicitation references the same way route layers do. No previously valid configuration is affected.

- **`global.defaults.<entity>.authentication:` is now applied.** It layers between global authentication and tag bundles, and its `replace_inherited: true` behavior matches bundle scope. **Breaking for existing config**: a document already carrying this previously inert block now runs its authentication steps.

- **An `authorization:` block whose phases are all empty is refused.** A block naming neither phase was already a load error, since it authorizes nothing and the has-APL gate would then drop the route as if it carried no policy. `pre_invocation: []` reached that same end state by another spelling and loaded clean. Layers append, so an empty list overrides nothing and cannot be a way to opt out of an inherited phase. A phase written empty beside one that carries steps still loads and means what it says. **Breaking for existing config**: a section whose only authorization content is an empty list stops loading; delete the block.

- **Normalizing a request path with a query or fragment no longer allocates unnecessarily.** Paths that require rewriting still allocate. Normalized output is unchanged except that a trailing slash before a query is now preserved.

- **Resolving an HTTP route name no longer clones the selector's path list.** Only the matched path is rendered; route names and behavior are unchanged.

- **The unreachable-authentication check stops walking the route table on every request.** The warn-once latch was only set when the scan found something to report, so the ordinary configuration, where no `http:` route declares `authentication:`, rescanned the route table on every identity-hook invocation that carried no readable path. Which routes can lose their list depends only on the configuration, so the answer is now computed once when a config lands and the request path reads it. A reload recomputes it, so the warning keeps naming the routes the current configuration declares. No configuration or behavior changes.

- **A stale `policy:` on a route reports the rename, and a route's bad keys are reported together.** The route-key scan runs before any visitor and did not know the pre-rename names, so a route carrying `policy:` failed with an unknown-key error listing every key a route accepts rather than the message naming `authorization.pre_invocation`. The rename check now runs first, off the same table the APL visitor reads. The scan also collects every unrecognized key on a route and names them in one error, so three typos take one load to find rather than three. A stale key still fails the load, which is what keeps a dropped authorization block from failing open.

- **HTTP route matching uses the host-supplied path.** Matching no longer normalizes before selection, keeping PPE aligned with the gateway and preventing dot segments from selecting a different policy. **Exact matches are now byte-for-byte**, so `/admin` and `/admin/` require separate routes; prefix matching is unchanged. Path normalization remains a fail-closed readability check.

- **Two routes narrowed by the same method in different case are refused at load.** Method matching ignores ASCII case, but the rendered route identity did not, so `method: GET` and `method: get` on one path passed the duplicate check and both matched every request, with the first declared silently winning. The identity now uppercases the method set before sorting it, so the two spellings are one name and the load fails naming both routes. A config carrying both stops loading, and a lowercase `method:` renders its name uppercase.

- **A route narrowed by `method:` now outranks the same path left open.** The narrowing gated the match without scoring, so two routes on one path resolved by declaration order: a broad `path_prefix: /api` written above `{path_prefix: /api, method: DELETE}` took the `DELETE` request, and swapping the two lines changed which policy ran. A present `method:` now adds to the score, below the per-character prefix weight so it breaks a tie within one path rather than reordering two paths, and below the scope bonus so a scoped route keeps winning its own scope. A configuration that pairs a broad route with a method-narrowed one moves those methods to the narrower policy.

- **A declared `http:` path that is not absolute is refused at load.** Matching reads the request path as given, so a selector whose path does not start with `/` can never match, and seven shapes of it loaded as dead routes with no signal at all. A bare path, a list element, `path:`, and `path_prefix:` are all checked now, and the error names the route and the path it read. A config declaring one stops loading; write the path with its leading slash.

- **A route can no longer claim the reserved catch-all name.** A route declaring `http: "*"` rendered `*` as its name, which is the name the entity-less catch-all policy is annotated under, so the route matched no request while its policy body governed every request that resolved no route, and it displaced the global `response:` block on the way. A route whose rendered names include the reserved name is now refused at load. The check reads the names the route contributes, so it covers every selector shape rather than the one spelling, and it runs whether or not routing is enabled, because the engine consults the annotation table either way.

- **An `http.method:` value that is not a method token is refused at load.** Methods are compared literally and there is no glob dialect, so `method: 'GET*'` matched nothing, and neither did a typo carrying a space or a slash. A value must now be an RFC 9110 token, with `*` excluded because it reads as a glob, and the error names the route and the value. An extension verb such as `PROPFIND` or `M-SEARCH` is unaffected.

- **Narrower `method:` sets now win on the same path.** For example, `method: GET` outranks `method: [GET, POST]` for GET requests instead of tying by declaration order. Scope and prefix-length precedence remain unchanged.

- **A body-less `http:` route no longer silences the response half.** A route whose effective layers declare only pre-phase steps installed a post handler that ran nothing, and that empty handler short-circuited the response-side plugin chain, so a configuration gained a catch-all `http:` route and lost whatever governed the way out. Each half now installs on the route path only when the route declares steps for it, which is the rule the global catch-all already applies.

- **An entity route's post-half plugins begin running.** The same missing guard covered `tool:`, `llm:`, `prompt:`, and `resource:` routes: a route listing `plugins:` alongside a policy body that declares only pre-phase steps installed an empty post handler that suppressed those plugins, so a plugin the operator wrote onto the route never ran on the post half. It runs now, so a plugin that denies there begins denying a call that previously passed. Check what the post-half plugins on such a route do before upgrading.

- **Concurrent registration no longer loses plugins.** Runtime writers now serialize copy-on-write publication while reads remain lock-free. Factory creation and dropped host objects run outside registry and writer locks, avoiding callback deadlocks; registrations made by a factory during creation are retained. ([#23](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/23))

- **HTTP and elicitation hooks now have complete routing metadata.** `http.request` is limited to pre-phase HTTP dispatch instead of accidentally matching every entity type and phase; `http.response` and `elicit` also report their correct metadata. Deployments relying on permissive reach must register the intended hooks or explicitly install `HookMetadata::permissive()`.

- **`MessageView::is_pre` and `is_post` now use registered hook metadata.** They no longer infer phase from the hook name, which misclassified names such as `cmf.llm_input`, `http.request`, and `express_lane`. Unregistered hooks report neither phase.

- **Subject claims keep their JSON shape.** `SubjectExtension.claims` holds `serde_json::Value` and flattens into the attribute bag through `payload::walk`, so Keycloak's nested `realm_access.roles` is a `StringSet` a policy can test instead of one opaque string. Client claims always worked this way. **Breaking** for Rust callers reading `claims`; `SubjectExtension::claim_str` covers the scalar lookups. Scalar policies such as `claim.tenant == 'acme'` are unaffected, but a structured claim now sets only the flattened children beneath `claim.<name>`, not the key itself, and a claim whose value is `{}` or `null` sets no key at all where it previously landed as stringified text. ([#9](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/pull/9))

- **A scalar array reaches the bag as a `StringSet` instead of no key.** `payload::walk` emitted nothing for `[]` or for any array holding a number or bool, so a user with no realm roles had no `claim.realm_access.roles`, and a provider minting `"group_ids": [1, 2]` had none of those either — a missing key is a CEL error that fail-closed handling denies. Numbers and bools now render as strings, so `claim.group_ids contains "1"`, matching how a float claim is carried through Cedar. An array holding a nested array or object still sets no key. Applies to `args.*`, `result.*`, `data.*` and `client.claim.*` too. ([#9](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/pull/9))

- **A float claim no longer denies every request through a Cedar step.** Cedar has no floating-point type, and a claim arrives in whatever shape the `IdP` minted, so a float claim is carried as its string form rather than rejected. Operator-authored `resource.attributes` still rejects one and names the key. ([#9](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/pull/9))

- **JWKS rotation no longer depends on a background runtime.** A host that dropped the runtime used during initialization also cancelled the refresh task, preventing recovery from key rotation or a failed boot fetch until restart. Refresh now occurs on relevant verification failures, single-flighted per issuer and rate-limited by `min_refresh_interval_secs`; the first request needing a new key can recover. ([#29](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/29))

- **An empty set no longer reads as a missing attribute.** Every `StringSet` the CMF bridge emits is now present-but-empty instead of omitted. Under CEL a missing key is an evaluation error that fail-closed handling turns into a denial, so `"x" in subject.roles` denied every subject that had no roles — a routine state, since a plugin without `read_roles` is handed an empty set. Does not cover an absent extension slot, where the namespace is missing entirely. ([#7](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/pull/7))

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-14

First release. The engine was extracted from another project rather than written here, so this entry records what moved, what changed on the way, and what the public surface now is.

### Added

- **The policy engine, ported from [`contextforge-org/cpex`](https://github.com/contextforge-org/cpex) with history intact.** Extracted with `git-filter-repo` at source commit `aed0f15`, 192 files across 37 filtered commits, so `git log` and `git blame` reach back before this repository existed. The Rego decision point came in a second pass from `fa222c4`. [`docs/port-provenance.md`](docs/port-provenance.md) records both anchors, which is what any later comparison between the two trees needs.

- **`praxis-policy`, a host facade.** One dependency instead of a dozen. It re-exports the runtime (`PolicyEngine`, `AplOptions`, `register_apl`) and owns registration of the bundled extensions, each behind its own feature. `default` is empty, so the bare dependency is the engine alone with nothing extra compiled in; `builtins` turns on the whole set, or name a subset (`jwt`, `oauth`, `elicitation-ciba`, `cedar`, `cel`, `opa`, `valkey`).

- **Three decision points, selectable per route.** Cedar policy sets (`cedar:`), inline CEL expressions (`cel:`), and embedded OPA/Rego via regorus (`opa:`). One binary serves all three; a route picks one with a step.

- **Bundled extensions:** multi-source JWT identity, RFC 8693 OAuth token delegation, out-of-band human approval over OIDC CIBA, and a Valkey-backed session store for taint that survives a restart.

- **Sensitive headers never reach a decision point.** `Authorization`, `Cookie` and `X-API-Key` are stripped from the projection a PDP receives, matched case-insensitively because headers arrive in whatever case the client sent. For a remote PDP that projection crosses the network, so this is the difference between consulting a policy service and handing it a bearer token.

- **A documented path for plugins the engine does not bundle.** Implement `PluginFactory` against `praxis_policy_core::prelude` and register it with `PolicyEngine::register_factory` under the `kind:` your policy names. An unrecognised `kind` fails at load, so a missing registration is a startup error naming the kind rather than a plugin that silently never runs. The prelude's doc example is compiled, not `ignore`d, so it cannot drift from what a plugin actually needs.

### Changed

- **Renamed to the Praxis Policy Engine throughout,** crates, types and docs. Deliberately unchanged: the policy document format, the `kind:` strings an operator writes, and the violation codes a client sees. Those are the surface a deployment depends on, and `crates/ppe-core/tests/wire_compatibility.rs` pins them against a document authored before the rename.

- **Edition 2024 and resolver 3,** with the MSRV pinned to the same toolchain the formatter and coverage run on, so there is one Rust version to reason about.

- **Six core crates instead of eight.** `praxis-policy-sdk` became `praxis_policy_core::prelude`: every name in it was already re-exported from core, so the separate crate offered a curated namespace and no dependency saving, which a module provides without a second crate to version. `praxis-policy-builtins` folded into the facade, because the feature list, the factory re-exports and the registration table all describe one set and can disagree when split across two crates.

- **The PII scanner and audit logger are no longer published or bundled.** They live under `reference/plugins/` as worked examples a host registers itself. The scanner is regex matching with no Luhn check, and the logger writes to stderr; neither is something a policy engine should ship as supported, and both are what a deployment will want to replace. **This is breaking** for anyone who had `features = ["pii"]` or `["audit"]`, or who named `PiiScannerFactory` / `AuditLoggerFactory`: register the factory instead.

### Fixed

- **A float in a Cedar attribute source denied every request through that step.** Cedar's value model has no floating-point type, so `attributes: { score: 1.5 }` failed entity construction with a message that named neither the attribute nor the reason. It now reports which key holds the float and what to supply instead. The same walker covers the operator-authored resource block.

- **A quoted argument containing a lone quote aborted the policy parser** instead of being read as a literal.

- **Branch outcomes are keyed rather than positional,** so a concurrent effect's result can no longer be attributed to the wrong branch.

### Security

- **`nbf` is now enforced on inbound JWTs.** `validate_nbf` is off by default in jsonwebtoken, unlike `validate_exp`, and nothing turned it on. The module documented `auth.token_not_yet_valid` as a stable code and mapped `ImmatureSignature` to it, but that error could never be produced, so a token whose own issuer said it was not valid until later was accepted the moment it was minted. Enforced under the same leeway that already covers `exp`, so ordinary clock skew is still tolerated. A deployment whose IdP deliberately mints a future `nbf` will start seeing that code.

- **An issuer accepting no signature algorithms now rejects every token from it,** rather than treating the empty list as "any algorithm is acceptable" and handing algorithm choice to whoever minted the token.

### Internal

- **Line coverage at 95%,** gated in CI by `COVERAGE_FLOOR` so it cannot silently regress. The `nbf` gap and the Cedar float defect both surfaced while writing those tests, which is the argument for the exercise.

- **191 lint rules configured across rustc, clippy and rustdoc,** every one at an explicit level. Anything that could silently change an enforcement decision is denied; [`docs/lints.md`](docs/lints.md) explains each group that is not.
