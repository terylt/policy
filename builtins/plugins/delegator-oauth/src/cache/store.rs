// The bounded, coalescing store behind the delegated-token cache.
//
// This module is mechanism. It holds no opinion about what makes two
// delegations the same — that is `key`'s job, and it is where the
// security argument lives. Everything here assumes it has been handed a
// correct key and concerns itself with three properties:
//
//   * **Bounded.** A caller able to vary any key component can create
//     entries. `max_entries` with LRU eviction is what stops that
//     growing without limit, so it is a mitigation rather than a tuning
//     knob.
//   * **Coalesced.** N concurrent requests for one uncached key must
//     produce one exchange, not N. A rotation or a cold start otherwise
//     points a stampede at the `IdP` at the moment it can least absorb
//     one.
//   * **Never wrong about failure.** A failed exchange is not an entry.
//     Neither is one that may or may not have reached the `IdP`.
//
// # Why moka rather than a guard map
//
// The obvious way to coalesce is a `HashMap<Key, Arc<Mutex<()>>>`
// alongside the cache. `oauth2-broker` does exactly that, and its guard
// map is inserted into and never pruned — so the structure that exists
// to protect the cache grows without the bound that protects the cache.
// Under the flooding scenario `max_entries` is there to survive, the
// guard map is the leak.
//
// moka's coalescing lives inside the bounded map, so one bound covers
// both. That is the reason for the dependency; the ergonomics are
// incidental.
//
// # Two clocks
//
// moka retires entries on a monotonic clock, which is the right choice
// for a cache and the wrong one for a credential. `Instant` does not
// advance across a host suspend on Linux or macOS, so a process resumed
// after an hour sees a monotonic clock that barely moved and a token
// that expired long ago.
//
// So retirement is monotonic, via [`ServeWindow`], and every read
// additionally re-runs that decision on the wall clock: both against
// the token's own `expires_at` and against the serve window the entry
// was created with, which is where `ttl_ceiling_seconds` lives. The
// first avoids a downstream 401; the second is what keeps the ceiling
// meaningful, since a long-lived token stays valid to the `IdP` well
// past the point the cache was supposed to stop reusing it.
