// Cache-key derivation for delegated tokens.
//
// This module is the security boundary of the cache. Everything else in
// `cache/` is mechanism; if the key is wrong, one caller is served a
// credential minted for another, the downstream service accepts it, and
// the action is attributed to the wrong principal. That failure is
// silent at every layer.
//
// # The rule
//
// A cache key must be derived from things a caller cannot forge. It is
// not enough for the components to be *hard* to guess: they must be
// values the caller either genuinely possesses (a credential) or that an
// operator wrote (configuration).
//
// # Anchored on the credential, not on the identity
//
// The load-bearing component is the credential being exchanged, not
// `security.subject.id`. This is deliberate and it is the opposite of
// what "cache per user" suggests.
//
// A derived identity is only as good as the mapping that produced it,
// and that mapping is operator-editable. A key built on it inherits
// whatever the claim map becomes, including a remap onto a claim that is
// not unique. The credential has no such indirection: two principals
// cannot present the same one unless one of them holds the other's
// token, at which point the cache is not what went wrong.
//
// This is not a theoretical preference. `fast-jwt` shipped exactly this
// choice as a configurable and it became GHSA-rp9m-7r4c-75qg, CVSS 9.1:
// a key builder that derived from claims collided two users' tokens and
// returned one user's claims for the other's token. Its *default* key,
// the token itself, was never affected. `curl` CVE-2022-22576 is the
// same shape at the connection layer, and FastMCP CVE-2025-69196 is the
// same shape with the target audience omitted.
//
// Consequently `security.subject.id` must not enter this key even as an
// *additional* component alongside the credential. It buys no isolation
// the credential does not already provide, and its presence is an
// invitation to later drop the credential and keep the identity, which
// is precisely the patch note above in reverse.
//
// # Unvalidated input is safe here, for a specific reason
//
// `bearer_token` reaches us straight off the wire, before validation
// (see `Capability::ReadInboundTokens` in praxis-policy-core, which says so
// explicitly). Keying on unvalidated input would normally be alarming.
//
// It is sound because the cache only ever stores a *confirmed* mint. A
// confirmed mint means the `IdP` accepted that exact credential during
// the exchange, so every anchor of every stored entry is a credential
// the `IdP` validated — even though the key was computed before anyone
// had checked it. Garbage in the anchor produces a failed exchange,
// which produces no entry.
//
// That argument covers isolation only. It does *not* cover rate
// limiting: a caller holding no valid credential at all can still emit a
// stream of invented tokens, each a distinct anchor, and drive one `IdP`
// round trip per request. A limiter keyed on the anchor is defeated by
// varying the anchor. See the module docs in `cache/mod.rs`.
//
// # Keyed, not bare
//
// The hash is an HMAC under a per-process secret rather than a plain
// digest, which buys two things. A key is safe to log, put in a metric
// label, or leave in a heap dump without becoming an oracle for "is this
// token live" — the property kubelet's token manager states as "keys
// should be nonconfidential and safe to log". And because the secret
// never leaves the process, an attacker who controls the anchor bytes
// still cannot steer the output: landing on a victim's key would require
// a second preimage under an unknown 256-bit key, with only a
// chosen-message oracle to work from.
