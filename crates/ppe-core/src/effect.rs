// Irreversible external effects, and the write-ahead log that records them.
//
// A decision record says what the engine ruled. It does not say what a
// plugin *did* to the outside world on the way: a token minted at an IdP,
// an approval granted. Those are irreversible and outlive the request, so
// recording them after the fact is not enough. A process that dies between
// "about to mint" and "minted" leaves no trace either way.
//
// The protocol is two-phase. A plugin durably records its intent before it
// acts, and records the outcome after. If the intent cannot be recorded the
// act does not happen (fail-closed), so a completed act always has a record.
// If the process dies in between, recovery finds the intent with no outcome
// and reconciles it against the participant.
//
// All of it is opt-in. With no log configured a plugin's effects run exactly
// as they would have, recording nothing.
