// 5-phase plugin execution engine.
//
// Dispatches plugins in strict phase order:
//   SEQUENTIAL → TRANSFORM → AUDIT → CONCURRENT → FIRE_AND_FORGET
//
// Each phase has different authority (block/modify) and scheduling
// (serial/parallel/background). The executor reads all scheduling
// decisions from PluginRef.trusted_config — never from the plugin.
//
// Extensions are passed separately from the payload and capability-
// filtered per plugin before dispatch. Extension modifications are
// merged back independently from payload modifications.
//
// Error handling respects the plugin's on_error setting:
//   - Fail: propagate error, halt pipeline
//   - Ignore: log error, continue pipeline
//   - Disable: log error, mark plugin disabled, continue
