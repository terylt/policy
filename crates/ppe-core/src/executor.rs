// 5-phase plugin execution engine.
//
// Dispatches plugins in strict phase order:
//   SEQUENTIAL → TRANSFORM → AUDIT → CONCURRENT → FIRE_AND_FORGET
//
// Each phase has different authority (block/modify) and scheduling
// (serial/parallel/background). The executor reads all scheduling
// decisions from PluginRef.trusted_config — never from the plugin.
//
// Extensions are passed separately from the payload and capability-
// filtered per plugin before dispatch. Extension modifications are
// merged back independently from payload modifications.
//
// Error handling respects the plugin's on_error setting:
//   - Fail: propagate error, halt pipeline
//   - Ignore: log error, continue pipeline
//   - Disable: log error, mark plugin disabled, continue
//
// A plugin panic is contained in every awaited phase (serial, transform,
// audit, concurrent): it is caught on the spawned task and routed through
// on_error, the same way error and timeout already were. Fire-and-forget
// panics are contained by spawn; they cannot change a verdict already
// returned.
//
// Containment costs a payload clone per plugin per hook. Audit used to
// take `&payload` and spawn nothing; it is no longer free. The spawn is
// load-bearing: it carries the timeout and abort-on-drop cancellation
// as well as the panic containment.

    // the plugin; `Ignore` continues and records the error for a programmatic
    // reader; `Disable` continues, records, and marks the plugin so it stops
