// Host-provided services, and the two carriers that hand them to a plugin.
//
// Some things a plugin needs cannot be compiled into PPE, because the
// embedding host already owns them: an HTTP stack with its pool and
// egress policy, and later a durable effect log. PPE defines the shape,
// the host installs an implementation, and a plugin borrows it.
//
// These are operations, not accessors: nothing hands the underlying
// service back, so a plugin has no handle to keep. Two reasons, and the
// first is the load-bearing one:
//
//   * The capability gate is recomputed per invocation. A plugin that
//     stashed a handle at startup would keep the authority after an
//     operator removed the capability and reloaded config, turning
//     "is allowed now" into "was allowed once".
//   * The carrier can attach per-request context a stored handle could
//     never know: the request's trace span, its remaining deadline, its
//     subrequest depth.
//
// The corollary is that background work cannot use these services at
// all: a `'static` task outlives the carrier by construction, so it has
// no invocation to borrow from and no gate to be checked against. That
// is a feature. `identity-jwt` used to refresh JWKS on a spawned ticker
// and it was silently dead under any host that dropped the runtime it
// initialized on; refreshing from the verify path needs no retained
// handle and no runtime of its own.
//
// Two carriers, because a plugin needs services at two points in its
// life and only one of them has a request:
//
//   * [`InitExtensions`] — during `Plugin::initialize_with`. No request
//     exists, so it carries services and nothing else. A JWKS fetch at
//     startup runs through this.
//   * `Extensions` — during hook dispatch. Already flows to every
//     plugin, already filtered by capability. A token exchange or an
//     on-demand JWKS refresh runs through this.
//
// Both implement [`HostServices`], so a plugin writes the work once
// against `&dyn HostServices` and the carrier becomes incidental:
//
// ```ignore
// async fn fetch_jwks(&self, svc: &dyn HostServices) -> Result<KeyStore, String> {
//     let http = svc.http_transport()?;
//     ...
// }
// ```
//
// `InitExtensions` is a distinct type rather than an `Extensions` with
// every slot empty. Handing a plugin a request context when there is no
// request invites reading `ext.security` at startup and getting a
// confusing `None`; here there is nothing to reach for.
