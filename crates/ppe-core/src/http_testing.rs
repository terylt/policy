// A scripted `HttpTransport` for tests.
//
// Once outbound HTTP is a seam, a plugin's tests no longer need a real
// server to exercise it. That is worth more than the convenience: a
// mock server can serve a document, but it cannot easily produce a
// connect failure, a timeout, or a response that arrives and then
// stalls — and those are the paths where a plugin's behaviour actually
// matters, because they decide between denying, retrying, and recording
// an outcome as indeterminate.
//
// So this exists to make the awkward half assertable. Wire mechanics are
// the transport's own concern and are tested against real sockets where
// the transport lives; what a plugin does with a `Timeout` is tested
// here, deterministically and without sleeping.
//
// Matching is by URL substring rather than by exact URL because test
// servers hand out ephemeral ports, and a test that has to thread a base
// URL through three layers to assert on a path is a test nobody updates.
