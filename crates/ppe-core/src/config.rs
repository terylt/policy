// Unified YAML configuration parsing.
//
// Parses the config format that combines global settings, plugin
// declarations, and per-entity routes into a single YAML document.
//
// Supports two dispatch modes, selected by `engine_settings.dispatch`:
//   - `policy` (default): a policy step names the plugin it invokes,
//     with `routes:`, `groups:`, and `global:` scoping the policy.
//   - `hooks`: each plugin declares the hooks it fires at and its own
//     `conditions:` for when it fires.
//
// The two modes are mutually exclusive and each rejects the other's
// keys by name. Hook mode rejects `routes:`, `groups:`, `global:`, and
// `global.defaults:`; policy mode rejects a per-plugin `conditions:`
// and a `plugins:` activation list at any scope.
