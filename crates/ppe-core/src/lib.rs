// PPE Core library root.
//
// Pure Rust plugin runtime with no FFI, WASM, or PyO3 dependencies.
// Provides the PolicyEngine, 5-phase executor, hook registry,
// unified config parser, and all core types.
//
// # Modules
//
// - [`plugin`] — Plugin trait, PluginRef, PluginMetadata, PluginConfig
// - [`hooks`]  — HookType (open string registry), payload/result traits
// - [`executor`] — 5-phase execution engine (sequential → transform → audit → concurrent → fire_and_forget)
// - [`engine`] — PolicyEngine lifecycle and hook dispatch
// - [`registry`] — PluginInstanceRegistry and HookRegistry
// - [`config`] — Unified YAML configuration parsing
// - [`factory`] — Plugin factory registry for config-driven instantiation
// - [`context`] — PluginContext (local_state + global_state)
// - [`audit`] — AuditHandler, the observation-only verdict sink
// - [`decision`] — DecisionLog, the executor's record of a pipeline run
// - [`effect`] — irreversible external acts, recorded write-ahead
// - [`cmf`] — Common Message Format (Message, ContentPart, enums)
// - [`identity`] — IdentityResolve hook family (subject / client /
//                   workload resolution from raw credentials)
// - [`delegation`] — TokenDelegate hook family (outbound credential
//                     minting for downstream calls)
// - [`elicitation`] — Elicitation hook family (human-in-the-loop:
//                     approval, confirmation, step-up, …)
// - [`error`] — Error types, violations, and result types

//! The plugin runtime: engine, executor, hook registry, and config parser.
//!
//! Pure Rust with no FFI, WASM, or Python bindings. Plugins register against
//! named hooks and the executor dispatches them in five phases, reading every
//! scheduling decision from trusted config rather than from the plugin.
