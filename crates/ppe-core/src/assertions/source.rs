// The source grammar: which slots an assertion may read, what reading one
// yields, and which paths are refused.
//
// Parsing is a match over the addressable set rather than a traversal, so a
// path that names nothing is rejected at config load by construction. Two
// refusals are deliberately distinct. Raw credentials and both wire header
// maps are never usable, in either direction, with no config surface to
// widen: rendering a client-supplied header into a header the upstream
// trusts is the laundering this feature exists to prevent, and an upstream
// that controls a response header must not be able to aim it at what the
// client trusts. The request line and the response status are refused for a
// different reason: they are host-populated rather than credential-bearing,
// so they are outside the grammar rather than excluded from it, and
// admitting them later should be a grammar addition.
//
// `secret.<name>` is the one source that does not come from the request. It
// names a value declared under `secrets.values`, never a provider and never a
// raw reference, which is what keeps the module's existing property intact: the
// engine originates every value a request entry asserts, so the legitimate set
// stays finite and enumerable from the document. A raw reference in the path
// would make the addressable set whatever the provider's credentials can reach,
// with no list an operator could audit.
