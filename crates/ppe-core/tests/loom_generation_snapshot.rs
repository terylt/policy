//! Extracted model of the `generation` / snapshot pairing `PolicyEngine`
//! documents on `mutate_runtime`.
//!
//! Production code publishes a snapshot and then bumps `generation` with
//! `Release`. Orchestrators load `generation` with `Acquire` and then load
//! the snapshot. A reader who observes a higher generation is intended to
//! see the snapshot stored before that bump.
//!
//! This file restates that pairing with loom atomics. It is documentation
//! of the intended order, not a harness over `engine.rs`: flipping the
//! real `Release` / `Acquire` sites to `Relaxed` does not fail this test.
//! Wiring it to the engine needs loom-aware snapshot storage (`arc_swap`
//! is not) and a `--cfg loom` build that CI does not run.
//!
//! Loom explores every allowed interleaving of those atomics. The model is
//! this pairing only: two threads, two atomics. A third writer thread is
//! not included — exhaustive search does not scale past this size, and
//! writers are already serialised by `runtime_write` in the engine.
