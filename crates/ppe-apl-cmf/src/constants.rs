// String constants used across praxis-policy-apl-cmf — capability names praxis-policy-core
// recognizes for `filter_extensions`, plus the bag-attribute
// prefixes APL extractors write under. Centralizing both makes the
// capability → bag namespace mapping in `capability_namespaces` a
// straight reference rather than a soup of inline strings, and
// gives operators / docs / tools one canonical place to read them
// from.
//
// # Source-of-truth invariants
//
// * `CAP_*` names match `praxis_policy_core::extensions::filter::filter_extensions`
//   verbatim. praxis-policy-core is authoritative — if it changes a cap name,
//   bump here and update the mapping table.
// * `BAG_*` prefixes match what the per-extension extractor modules
//   (`security.rs`, `delegation.rs`, etc.) actually write into the
//   bag. The extractor files still use string literals today; a
//   future cleanup can refactor them to consume these constants to
//   prevent drift. Tests in `capability_namespaces` flag the
//   contract.
