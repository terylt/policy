//! **PPE is a policy enforcement runtime for AI agents.**
//!
//! It is a deterministic reference monitor between an agent and every
//! capability it invokes: tools, prompts, resources, inference providers, and
//! A2A methods. Each operation runs through a policy-defined pipeline that can
//! resolve identity, make an authorization decision (delegated to an engine
//! like Cedar or CEL), exchange and reduce credentials before a downstream
//! call, redact inputs and outputs, track information flow across calls, and
//! audit. You write that policy declaratively in APL, the configuration that
//! defines each operation's pipeline; PPE evaluates and enforces it at the
//! boundary, against state the model cannot observe or forge.
//!
//! - Source and issues: <https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy>
//!
//! # This crate
//!
//! `praxis-policy` is the **host facade**: one dependency that re-exports the PPE
//! runtime (`praxis-policy-core`, `praxis-policy-apl-core`, `praxis-policy-apl-cmf`, `praxis-policy-apl-runtime`), so a host depends
//! on this crate instead of pinning each of them separately.
//!
//! By default it is the **engine only**: no builtin plugins are compiled in.
//! The bundled plugins, PDPs and session stores are registered from here, each
//! behind a feature, and only what you enable is compiled.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Engine only (register your own factories):
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! use praxis_policy::PolicyEngine;
//!
//! let mgr = Arc::new(PolicyEngine::default());
//! // ... register host factories, then `praxis_policy_apl_runtime::register_apl(&mgr, opts)`.
//! ```
//!
//! With the bundled builtins (enable the `builtins` feature):
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! use praxis_policy::PolicyEngine;
//!
//! let mgr = Arc::new(PolicyEngine::default());
//! // Register every enabled builtin factory and install the APL config
//! // visitor (in-process defaults) in one call:
//! praxis_policy::install_builtins(&mgr);
//! // ... then load a config that references the enabled `kind`s.
//! ```
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! No plugins are on by default (`praxis-policy` alone is the engine).
//! `builtins` enables every bundled extension, including the Valkey session
//! store; or pick a granular subset (`jwt`, `oauth`, `elicitation-ciba`,
//! `cedar`, `cel`, `opa`, `valkey`). Any of them brings in the registration
//! helpers, and each one re-exports its own concrete factory type here.
//!
//! # Plugins the host supplies
//!
//! A plugin does not have to be bundled. Implement [`PluginFactory`] and hand it
//! to [`PolicyEngine::register_factory`] under the `kind:` your YAML names;
//! [`prelude`] is the surface to write it against. An unrecognised `kind` is a
//! load-time error, so a missing registration fails at startup rather than
//! silently skipping the plugin.
//!
//! `reference/plugins/` in this repository holds two worked examples, a PII
//! scanner and an audit logger. Neither is published or bundled; a host registers
//! them.

// Whole-crate re-exports for advanced use (types not surfaced below).
