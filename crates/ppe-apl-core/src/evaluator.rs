// APL evaluator — walks the IR against an AttributeBag and returns a Decision.
//
// The evaluator is sync. Missing attributes resolve to `false` for
// presence, equality, membership, and order; operator type mismatches on
// equality and membership resolve to `false`. `!=` is the exception: an
// absent key is not equal to a concrete value, so `NotEq` is true,
// matching `!(x == y)`. A deny rule written as `subject.role != "admin"`
// therefore fires when the role is missing rather than falling through
// to Allow.
//
// Order comparison on a *present* value that is not a finite number is
// not a boolean. `false` skips a deny rule; `true` inverts under `!`.
// The phase Denies instead, with a reason that says fail-closed.
// The host drives the four phases separately by calling `evaluate_rules` once
// per declared phase — phase orchestration lives in `praxis-policy-apl-runtime`.
//
// Semantics:
//   - operators, actions, require
//   - native fast-path, sync inside async outer
