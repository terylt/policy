//! The conformance corpus: one accepted and one rejected case per rule the
//! grammar states.
//!
//! `docs/content/apl/apl-grammar.md` is the normative document and this is what
//! holds it to account. Every production, every breaking change, and every documented wart the
//! *parser* decides has a case in one of the modules below, and every rejected
//! case asserts on the *message* rather than only on being an error. A tightening
//! that fails for the wrong reason passes an `is_err` test and tells an operator
//! nothing, which is the failure mode this work exists to remove.
//!
//! Two of the document's warts are out of scope here, settled after the parse
//! rather than by it: the elicitation `scope:` parsed at request time, and
//! static-tags-only inheritance. Both belong to a runtime or config suite.
//!
//! # Why this file exists at all
//!
//! Cargo auto-discovers `tests/*.rs` and `tests/<dir>/main.rs`, and ignores loose
//! files under `tests/<dir>/`. Without this entry point the modules below would
//! compile never and run never, while the suite stayed green: exactly the silent
//! gap the corpus is here to close. If you add a case module, declare it here.
//!
//! One binary rather than three also costs one process launch rather than three,
//! which on macOS with an endpoint-security agent installed is the difference
//! between a fast test run and a slow one. See AGENTS.md.
