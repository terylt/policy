// `AplRouteHandler` — synthetic plugin that drives APL evaluation when
// praxis-policy-core's `filter_entries_by_route` matches an annotated route. Each
// instance is bound to ONE phase (Pre or Post) so the unified-config
// `cmf.tool_pre_invoke` and `cmf.tool_post_invoke` hooks can carry
// distinct handler logic without an in-handler hook-name discriminator.
//
// # Why a phase-bound handler
//
// The PPE engine's annotation table is keyed on
// `(entity_type, entity_name, scope, hook_name)`. The visitor registers
// one handler per route per phase; the engine picks the right one based
// on the dispatching hook name. Inside `invoke`, no hook-name plumbing is
// needed — the handler already knows which phase it's running.
//
// # Why the family is fixed at install too
//
// The route's entity type decides which hook family its handler is
// annotated under, and the family decides the payload the executor hands
// it: a CMF message for the MCP and A2A entities, `HttpPayload` for
// generic HTTP. So the family is recorded at install alongside the phase,
// and it selects both the payload `invoke` accepts and the typed invoker
// the request's plugins are dispatched through.
//
// # Lifetime / weak engine handle
//
// The handler holds `Weak<PolicyEngine>` because the engine owns the
// snapshot that owns the annotation that owns the handler — a strong
// reference would create a cycle. Each `invoke` upgrades to `Arc` for
// the duration of the call. If the upgrade fails (engine has been
// dropped) the call returns a configuration error.
