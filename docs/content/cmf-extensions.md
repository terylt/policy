# CMF extensions and the attribute bag

A policy is written against a flat `AttributeBag`. The bag is filled by
`praxis-policy-apl-cmf`: each present slot on `Extensions` is walked into dotted
keys. Plugins that received the typed slot still see the original struct. This
document is the contract for what the bridge emits, how original collections
relate to flattened booleans, and which keys exist.

The twelve slots dispatched by `extract_extensions` are listed below.
`raw_credentials` and `candidate_constraint` are not among them: credentials
never enter the bag, and a routing constraint is not a policy attribute.

## Absent values

The rule is per **attribute type**, and it only applies inside a **present
slot**. An absent slot writes nothing for its namespace. CEL then reports an
undeclared reference for that namespace; synthesizing empty namespaces for
missing slots is out of scope.

| Type | When the field is empty or `None` | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `StringSet` | **Present and empty.** Membership is false. | CEL treats a missing key as an evaluation error. `!("banned" in subject.roles)` would deny every subject with no roles — a routine state, including a plugin that lacks `read_roles` and is handed an empty set. |
| `Bool` as a real field (`delegation.delegated`) | **Present**, including `false`. | The field is not optional on the struct. |
| `Bool` as a flattened member (`role.hr`) | **Omitted.** Presence means true. | Emitting `false` for every name that is not a member is impossible. APL reads a missing flattened bool as false. Do not guard CEL with `has(role.hr)`: when no `role.*` keys exist the `role` namespace was never written, and `has(role.hr)` is an evaluation error. Use the always-present `subject.roles` set (`"hr" in subject.roles`). |
| `Bool` derived (`authenticated`) | **Omitted** unless `subject.id` is set. | Absence is "not authenticated" in APL (`!authenticated` is true; `require(authenticated)` denies). `has(authenticated)` is a compile error (`has()` rejects a bare name), so that key itself cannot be guarded in CEL. When the `subject` namespace exists — a present subject writes empty `subject.roles` / `permissions` / `teams` even with no id — `has(subject.id)` is a valid substitute. Only a completely absent subject (no `subject.*` keys) leaves CEL with no guard; the deny then reaches the operator as a key error. Contrast `delegation.delegated`, a non-option field that is always written, including `false`. |
| `String` | **Omitted** when `Option::None`. A non-option string (`client.client_id`) is always written, even if empty. | Empty string and missing are different questions (`exists(subject.id)` vs `subject.id == ""`). |
| `Int` | **Omitted** when `Option::None` (`http.status`, `agent.turn`, `completion.latency_ms`). A non-option int (`delegation.depth`) is always written, including `0`. | Emitting `0` for an unset HTTP status would make `http.status >= 500` and `http.status == 0` both lie. |
| `Float` | Same as `Int`. `delegation.age_seconds` is non-option and always written, including `0.0`. | Same reason: a missing telemetry field is not zero. |
| JSON object / claims map | **No parent key.** Each scalar (or scalar-array) child is written under a dotted path. `{}`, `null`, and an array holding a nested container set nothing. | The bag has no map type. See [`subject.claims`](#subjectclaims). |

`ppe-pdp-diff` is the executable form of this table for the keys Cedar can
see. Empty `subject.teams` and a subject with no roles (no `role.*` keys,
empty `subject.roles`) must Deny on APL, CEL, cedar-direct, and OPA when the
policy is a membership or flattened-bool gate. Unguarded **presence,
equality, membership, and order** probes of an omitted claim scalar also
Deny on all four (CEL and Cedar report a key error rather than a policy
false). That agreement does **not** cover APL `!=` or `not in`: those
evaluate true on a missing key, so `require(claim.tenant != "acme")`
Allows in APL while CEL, cedar-direct, and OPA Deny. `not in` Allows in
APL (and in OPA, where `not` of undefined is true) while CEL and
cedar-direct Deny. A flattened bool whose namespace was never
written, and a missing `subject.id`, remain allowlisted: CEL is an eval
error, Cedar cannot build a principal without an id, and making those
agree needs CEL root seeding and a generated Cedar schema, which is a
follow-up to [#18](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/issues/18).

## Original collections and flattened booleans

[Pull request #7](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/policy/pull/7) added the
original CMF collections as bag keys alongside the flattened booleans that
were already there.

| Original (the set) | Flattened (presence-only) | Write |
|---|---|---|
| `subject.roles` | `role.<name> = true` | Both, from the same `HashSet`. |
| `subject.permissions` | `perm.<name> = true` | Same. |
| `subject.teams` | `team.<name> = true` | Same. |
| `client.roles` | `client.role.<name> = true` | Same. |
| `client.permissions` | `client.perm.<name> = true` | Same. |

The set is the primary form. The five flattened collections exist because
`require(role.hr)` predates the original sets; no more are added. Nine
other `StringSet`s are set-only — `client.teams`,
`client.authorized_scopes`, `client.authorized_audiences`,
`caller_workload.selectors`, `this_workload.selectors`, `security.labels`,
`agent.conversation.topics`, `meta.tags`, `llm.capabilities` — so
`require(tag.pii)` is false forever, by design.

**Authors should use the original set** for membership (`subject.roles contains
"hr"` in APL, `"hr" in subject.roles` in CEL, `"hr" in input.subject.roles` in
OPA). That key is present whenever the subject (or client) sub-record is, so
the four decision points agree on empty.

Flattened booleans are an APL convenience: `require(role.hr)` is false when the
key is missing. They are not a second source of truth. The bridge always
derives them from the set, so as emitted they cannot disagree. A later
`AttributeBag::set` that writes one and not the other **last write wins** on
that key; the other key is left as it was. Do not mix a hand-built bag with
the bridge if you need them to stay paired.

Cedar does not read the bag the way CEL and OPA do. `principal.roles` and
`principal.permissions` are rebuilt from flattened `role.*` / `perm.*` trues.
`principal.teams` is read from the original `subject.teams` set. Cedar does
not surface `client.*`, `http.*`, or the other slots as principal attributes.
A Cedar policy that needs those values does not get them from this mapping.

## `subject.claims`

There is no `subject.claims` bag key, and there will not be one until the bag
gains a map type.

`AttributeValue` is `Bool`, `Int`, `Float`, `String`, or `StringSet`. A JWT
claim object is none of those. The bridge walks each claim through the same
JSON flattener as `custom.*` and `args.*`:

- a scalar lands at `claim.<name>` with its type kept
- a scalar array, empty included, lands as a `StringSet` (numbers and bools
  rendered as strings)
- `{}`, `null`, and an array holding a nested container set no key
- a nested object sets only the children (`claim.realm_access.roles`), never
  the parent (`claim.realm_access`)

Client claims are the same shape under `client.claim.<name>`.

That is enough for every predicate the language can ask: `claim.tenant ==
"acme"`, `claim.realm_access.roles contains "admin"`. What it cannot do is
treat the whole map as one value (`exists(subject.claims)` meaning "any
claim"). Cedar still injects an empty `principal.claims` record so a probe of
the record itself is not a missing-attribute error; individual missing claim
names inside it follow Cedar's own rules.

To put a dict in the bag would take a sixth `AttributeValue` variant, APL
lookup into it, CEL map construction (already nested from dotted keys, so
partly redundant), a Cedar record that is not string-keyed leftovers, and an
OPA object. The flattened keys would still be required for the predicates that
exist today. Until that type exists, `claim.*` / `client.claim.*` are the
policy surface, and `SubjectExtension.claims` remains the typed form plugins
read.

## What each decision point does with a missing key

| Engine | Missing key | Empty `StringSet` |
|---|---|---|
| APL | false for presence, equality, membership, and order. Every negated form is true: `!=`, `!key`, `!(...)`, and `not in`. Negation is spelled `!`; `not` is reserved for the `not in` phrase, so the idiom is `!authenticated`. | `contains` / `in` is false |
| CEL | evaluation error; default `OnError::Deny` turns it into a denial that reports a key error, not a policy false | `in` is false |
| cedar-direct | empty `roles` / `permissions` / `teams` / `claims` on the principal so those names exist; no `subject.id` is a dispatch error. A missing `subject.type` defaults to `User` (PascalCase). The bridge writes lowercase (`user` / `agent` / `service` / `system`), so a type-scoped policy (`principal is user` vs `User`) can miss a principal whose type was omitted. | `contains` is false |
| OPA | undefined; without `default allow := false` the query is a default deny. `not` of undefined is true, so a denylist written `not (x in y)` Allows when `y` is missing. | `in` is false |

`require` inverts its predicate and denies when that inversion is true, so
the APL row above splits `require` on a missing key:

| Rule (omitted keys) | APL | Other engines |
|---|---|---|
| `require(claim.tenant == "acme")` | Deny | Deny |
| `require(subject.roles contains "hr")` | Deny | Deny |
| `require(claim.tenant != "acme")` | Allow | Deny |
| `require(subject.type not in blocked_types)` | Allow | CEL and cedar-direct Deny. OPA Allows: `not` of an undefined set is true. |

Authors who need the denylist to stay closed when the key is missing write
`require(exists(claim.tenant) & claim.tenant != "acme")`.

A policy written against a **present-empty set** therefore agrees — including
when Cedar reads flattened `role.*` and CEL reads `subject.roles`, because the
bridge filled both from the same set. A policy written against an **omitted
claim scalar** agrees on the verdict (all Deny) for `==`, order, and
membership, and is an `AgreeDeny` in `ppe-pdp-diff`; the cause still differs.
`!=` and `not in` do **not** agree across all four engines: they are
`missing-claim-not-eq` / `missing-not-in` on the allowlist. A flattened bool
whose namespace was never written (unguarded CEL `role.hr` with no `role.*`
keys), or a missing `subject.id`, is the `missing-collection` /
`missing-subject-id` class of split.

## The twelve slots

Keys listed **always** are written whenever the slot (and, where noted, the
sub-record) is present. The rest are omitted when the field is `None` or the
map has no entry.

### 1. `security` — `SecurityExtension`

**Subject** (`sec.subject` present):

| Key | Type | When |
|---|---|---|
| `subject.id` | String | `id` is `Some` |
| `subject.type` | String (`user` / `agent` / `service` / `system`) | `subject_type` is `Some`. cedar-direct, given no key, still builds a principal typed `User`; bridged values are lowercase. |
| `subject.roles` | StringSet | always |
| `role.<name>` | Bool (`true`) | each member of `roles` |
| `subject.permissions` | StringSet | always |
| `perm.<name>` | Bool (`true`) | each member of `permissions` |
| `subject.teams` | StringSet | always |
| `team.<name>` | Bool (`true`) | each member of `teams` |
| `claim.<dotted>` | flattened JSON | each claim; see [`subject.claims`](#subjectclaims) |
| `authenticated` | Bool (`true`) | `id` is `Some` |

**Client** (`sec.client` present):

| Key | Type | When |
|---|---|---|
| `client.client_id` | String | always |
| `client.client_name` | String | `Some` |
| `client.trust_level` | String | always (`first_party` / `third_party` / `internal` / custom / `unknown`) |
| `client.roles` | StringSet | always |
| `client.role.<name>` | Bool (`true`) | each member |
| `client.permissions` | StringSet | always |
| `client.perm.<name>` | Bool (`true`) | each member |
| `client.authorized_scopes` | StringSet | always |
| `client.authorized_audiences` | StringSet | always |
| `client.teams` | StringSet | always |
| `client.claim.<dotted>` | flattened JSON | each claim |

**Workload** (`caller_workload` / `this_workload`; same shape, two namespaces).
These are not `agent.*`. `agent.*` is session context.

| Key | Type | When |
|---|---|---|
| `<ns>.spiffe_id` | String | `Some` |
| `<ns>.trust_domain` | String | `Some` |
| `<ns>.attestor` | String | `Some` |
| `<ns>.selectors` | StringSet | always |
| `<ns>.client_id` | String | `Some` |

`attested_at` is not in the bag. `request.timestamp` and
`completion.created_at` are carried as plain strings, so the bag does not
refuse timestamps; unifying the three is out of scope here.

**Other**, written whenever the security slot itself is present:

| Key | Type | When |
|---|---|---|
| `auth_method` | String | `Some` |
| `security.labels` | StringSet | always |
| `security.classification` | String | `Some` |

`security.objects` and `security.data` are not in the bag. Both live on
`SecurityExtension`, and `filter_extensions` copies them to every plugin
(unrestricted sub-fields). The bridge does not flatten
`ObjectSecurityProfile` or `DataPolicy` (`apply_labels`, `allowed_actions`,
`denied_actions`, `retention`). Plugins that need them read the typed slot.
The static `data:` payload tree (`data.*` keys) is a different source; see
[Payloads that are not slots](#payloads-that-are-not-slots).

`capability_namespaces` maps `read_*` capabilities to bag prefixes. `read_labels`
unlocks `security.labels`; `read_workload` unlocks `caller_workload.*` and
`this_workload.*`. Nothing writes a `workload.*` prefix.

### 2. `delegation` — `DelegationExtension`

| Key | Type | When |
|---|---|---|
| `delegation.depth` | Int | always (0 if none) |
| `delegation.delegated` | Bool | always |
| `delegated` | Bool | always (alias of the previous) |
| `delegation.origin_subject_id` | String | `Some` |
| `delegation.actor_subject_id` | String | `Some` |
| `delegation.age_seconds` | Float | always |

Per-hop scopes, audience, and strategy stay on the typed chain.

### 3. `agent` — `AgentExtension`

| Key | Type | When |
|---|---|---|
| `agent.input` | String | `Some` |
| `agent.session_id` | String | `Some` |
| `agent.conversation_id` | String | `Some` |
| `agent.turn` | Int | `Some` |
| `agent.agent_id` | String | `Some` |
| `agent.parent_agent_id` | String | `Some` |
| `agent.conversation.summary` | String | conversation present and summary `Some` |
| `agent.conversation.topics` | StringSet | conversation present (always then) |

`conversation.history` is not flattened.

### 4. `meta` — `MetaExtension`

| Key | Type | When |
|---|---|---|
| `meta.entity_type` | String | `Some` |
| `meta.entity_name` | String | `Some` |
| `meta.tags` | StringSet | always |
| `meta.scope` | String | `Some` |
| `meta.properties.<k>` | String | each map entry |

### 5. `request` — `RequestExtension`

| Key | Type | When |
|---|---|---|
| `request.environment` | String | `Some` |
| `request.request_id` | String | `Some` |
| `request.timestamp` | String | `Some` (ISO 8601 text) |
| `request.trace_id` | String | `Some` |
| `request.span_id` | String | `Some` |

A default request slot adds nothing.

### 6. `http` — `HttpExtension`

| Key | Type | When |
|---|---|---|
| `http.method` | String | `Some` |
| `http.path` | String | `Some` |
| `http.host` | String | `Some` |
| `http.scheme` | String | `Some` |
| `http.status` | Int | `Some` (response half) |
| `http.request_headers.<name>` | String | each header; name lowercased |
| `http.response_headers.<name>` | String | each header; name lowercased |

### 7. `llm` — `LLMExtension`

| Key | Type | When |
|---|---|---|
| `llm.model_id` | String | `Some` |
| `llm.provider` | String | `Some` |
| `llm.capabilities` | StringSet | always |

### 8. `mcp` — `MCPExtension`

**Tool** present:

| Key | Type | When |
|---|---|---|
| `mcp.tool.name` | String | always |
| `mcp.tool.title` | String | `Some` |
| `mcp.tool.description` | String | `Some` |
| `mcp.tool.server_id` | String | `Some` |
| `mcp.tool.namespace` | String | `Some` |

**Resource** present:

| Key | Type | When |
|---|---|---|
| `mcp.resource.uri` | String | always |
| `mcp.resource.name` | String | `Some` |
| `mcp.resource.description` | String | `Some` |
| `mcp.resource.mime_type` | String | `Some` |
| `mcp.resource.server_id` | String | `Some` |

**Prompt** present:

| Key | Type | When |
|---|---|---|
| `mcp.prompt.name` | String | always |
| `mcp.prompt.description` | String | `Some` |
| `mcp.prompt.server_id` | String | `Some` |

Schemas and annotations are not flattened.

### 9. `completion` — `CompletionExtension`

| Key | Type | When |
|---|---|---|
| `completion.stop_reason` | String | `Some` (`end` / `return` / `call` / `max_tokens` / `stop_sequence`) |
| `completion.tokens.input` | Int | tokens present |
| `completion.tokens.output` | Int | tokens present |
| `completion.tokens.total` | Int | tokens present |
| `completion.model` | String | `Some` |
| `completion.raw_format` | String | `Some` |
| `completion.created_at` | String | `Some` |
| `completion.latency_ms` | Int | `Some` |

### 10. `provenance` — `ProvenanceExtension`

| Key | Type | When |
|---|---|---|
| `provenance.source` | String | `Some` |
| `provenance.message_id` | String | `Some` |
| `provenance.parent_id` | String | `Some` |

### 11. `framework` — `FrameworkExtension`

| Key | Type | When |
|---|---|---|
| `framework.framework` | String | `Some` |
| `framework.framework_version` | String | `Some` |
| `framework.node_id` | String | `Some` |
| `framework.graph_id` | String | `Some` |
| `framework.metadata.<dotted>` | flattened JSON | each metadata entry |

### 12. `custom` — `HashMap<String, Value>`

| Key | Type | When |
|---|---|---|
| `custom.<dotted>` | flattened JSON | each map entry |

An empty map adds nothing.

## Payloads that are not slots

These use the same walker and the same absent-value rules, but they are not
`extract_extensions` slots:

| Source | Keys |
|---|---|
| Request arguments | Object fields: `args.<dotted>`. A top-level scalar is the key `args` (String / Bool / Int / Float). A top-level scalar array is `args` as a StringSet (empty included). A top-level array of objects or nested arrays sets nothing. `null` sets nothing. |
| Upstream result | Same shapes under `result` / `result.<dotted>`. |
| Static `data:` tree | Same walker under `data` / `data.<dotted>`. |
| Route identifier | `route.key` |
