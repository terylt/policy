# PDP Integration

APL predicates handle attribute checks well: roles, permissions, scopes,
comparisons. They are a poor fit for relationship questions ("is this user on
the team that owns this repo?") and for policy you already maintain in a
dedicated engine. For those, APL hands the decision to a Policy Decision
Point.

## Decision requirement

The scenario's repository search must allow a read when the caller is an
engineer and the repo is internal, or when the caller is on the security team,
regardless of repo. That is a relationship-and-attribute decision over entities,
which is exactly what an engine like Cedar exists to express. APL should make
the coarse gate and let the engine make the fine-grained call.

## Calling a PDP from policy

A PDP call is an effect in the `authorization.pre_invocation` phase. It names a
dialect and passes the request; `on_allow` and `on_deny` react to the decision:

<!-- validate: route-body -->
```yaml
authorization:
  pre_invocation:
    - "require(team.engineering | team.security)"
    - cedar:
        action: 'Action::"read"'
        resource:
          type: Repo
          id: ${args.repo_name}
          attributes:
            visibility: ${args.visibility}
        on_deny:
          - "deny('not permitted by repo policy', 'cedar_denied')"
```

The cheap APL gate runs first. Only if it passes does PPE evaluate the Cedar
policy against the request entities. The Cedar policy itself lives in the
config:

```yaml
global:
  pdp:
    - kind: cedar-direct
      policy_text: |
        @id("engineering-internal-repos")
        permit(principal, action == Action::"read", resource is Repo)
        when {
          principal.roles.contains("engineer") &&
          resource.visibility == "internal"
        };

        @id("security-team-any-repo")
        permit(principal, action == Action::"read", resource is Repo)
        when { principal.roles.contains("security") };
```

## Supported dialects

APL recognizes a fixed set of PDP dialects. Three ship as builtin resolvers; the
rest are recognized by APL and dispatched to a resolver you provide on the host.

| Dialect | Status |
|---------|--------|
| `cedar` | Ships as the `cedar-direct` builtin resolver. |
| `cel` | Ships as the `cel` builtin resolver (safe, bounded expressions). |
| `opa` | Ships as the `opa` builtin resolver (embedded Rego via regorus, no sidecar). |
| `authzen` | Recognized dialect; wire a host resolver (AuthZEN protocol). |
| `nemo` | Recognized dialect; wire a host resolver (NeMo Guardrails). |

This is a deliberate pluggable-resolver surface, not a maturity checklist. APL
speaks the dialect; the resolver is an implementation. Cedar, CEL, and OPA are
provided so you can start without writing one. For AuthZEN or NeMo, implement
the resolver trait and register it; the APL `authzen:` / `nemo:` call forms then
work unchanged.

CEL is the lightest option for inline boolean policy:

<!-- validate: route-body -->
```yaml
authorization:
  pre_invocation:
    - cel: { expr: "subject.department == 'compliance' || 'admin' in subject.roles" }
```

## Pipeline integration

A PDP resolver is registered with the manager like any other capability. When
the evaluator hits a PDP effect, it dispatches to the resolver for that dialect,
passing the attribute bag and the call's arguments, and routes the `Allow` /
`Deny` decision through `on_allow` / `on_deny`. The decision and its diagnostics
are recorded in the audit log. See [Effects](effects.md) for how PDP reactions
sequence with the rest of a policy.
