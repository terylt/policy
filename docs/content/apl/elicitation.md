# Human-in-the-Loop Elicitation

Some operations should not proceed on the caller's say-so alone. A large payroll
change wants a manager's approval; a destructive action wants the user to
confirm; a sensitive read wants a fresh second factor. Elicitation lets a policy
pause an operation to ask a human and resume once they respond — without
blocking the request path, and with the decision bound to the actual request
rather than to an LLM's paraphrase of it.

## Approval requirement

The scenario's `approve_raise` may run only after the requester's manager
approves, and the approval must cover the specific amount being requested. The
manager is not the caller, may take hours to respond, and their answer must be
genuine — a signed decision from the right person, not a value the agent
asserts. PPE must dispatch the ask, hold the operation open across the agent's
retries, and verify the response before letting the tool run.

## Elicitation as an effect

Elicitation is an effect in the `authorization.pre_invocation` phase. A sugar
verb names an elicitation handler plugin and who to ask:

```yaml
plugins:
  - name: manager-approver
    kind: elicitation/ciba
    hooks: [elicit]

routes:
  - tool: approve_raise
    authorization:
      pre_invocation:
        - "require(authenticated)"
        - when: "args.amount > 10000"
          do:
            - "require_approval(manager-approver, from: claim.manager,
                                 channel: \"ciba\",
                                 scope: \"args.amount <= 25000\",
                                 purpose: \"Approve raise\")"
```

- `from` is who to ask — an attribute reference resolved against the request
  bag (here `claim.manager`, the requester's manager, who differs from the
  subject). An attribute `from` that doesn't resolve fails closed rather than
  dispatching to a bogus identity.
- `scope` is the args binding — an APL boolean expression the runtime checks
  against the live request when the response comes back.
- `purpose` is the audited, human-readable description of what is being
  asked.

The other verbs (`confirm`, `require_step_up`, `require_attestation`,
`request_info`, `require_review`) parse to the same effect with a different
kind; each selects the validation contract the runtime applies to the response.

## The model: suspend and resume

An elicitation has three short, synchronous touch-points. The hours-long human
gap lives in the channel (e.g. Keycloak CIBA), never in a blocking call:

1. Dispatch — first arrival: register the intent, open the channel
   backchannel, return a correlation id.
2. Check — on each agent retry: read status (`pending` / `resolved` /
   `expired`) without blocking.
3. Validate — once resolved: verify the response is *genuine*, then the
   runtime layers the `scope`-over-args *sufficiency* check before honoring the
   approval.

While pending, the phase suspends rather than denies. The decision stays
`Allow`, but a pending marker rides alongside it, and the host maps that to
JSON-RPC `-32120` ("not complete — retry echoing this id"). The forward rule
is one clause: *forward only when the decision is `Allow` and nothing is
pending.* Expiry, channel error, a genuine denial, or a failed validation all
fail closed (default `on_error: deny`).

![The elicitation suspend-and-resume flow: an agent request hits require_approval, which opens a Keycloak CIBA backchannel and returns -32120 with an elicitation id; agent retries hit a non-blocking status check that keeps returning pending until the channel resolves; validate then verifies genuineness and scope over the live args, forwarding to the tool when approved and sufficient, and failing closed on denial, expiry, or invalid responses](../../images/apl_elicitation_flow.svg)

## The CIBA channel plugin

The bundled `elicitation/ciba` plugin drives the ask through OpenID Connect CIBA
(Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication) against Keycloak or any
CIBA-capable OP:

```yaml
plugins:
  - name: manager-approver
    kind: elicitation/ciba
    hooks: [elicit]
    config:
      backchannel_endpoint: "https://idp.example.com/realms/corp/protocol/openid-connect/ext/ciba/auth"
      token_endpoint:       "https://idp.example.com/realms/corp/protocol/openid-connect/token"
      client_id: "ppe-gateway"
      client_secret_source:
        kind: file
        path: /etc/ppe-secrets/client-secret
      approver_claim: preferred_username
```

`from` becomes the CIBA `login_hint`, `purpose` seeds the `binding_message`, and
`timeout` maps to `requested_expiry`. Dispatch returns an `auth_req_id` that
doubles as the elicitation id the agent echoes on retry.

## Elicitation attributes

Dispatch and resolution write `elicitation.*` attributes that later rules in the
same phase — and the audit log — can read:

| Attribute | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `elicitation.id` | Correlation id the agent echoes on retry. |
| `elicitation.status` | `pending` / `resolved` / `expired`. |
| `elicitation.outcome` | `approved` / `denied`, once resolved. |
| `elicitation.approver` | Resolved approver identity, cross-checked against `from`. |
| `elicitation.channel` | Audit label for how the human was reached (not a routing key). |

## Genuineness and argument binding

Two independent checks stand between an approval and the tool call:

- Genuineness is the channel plugin's job. For CIBA, the approver identity
  is extracted from the token the OP returns and cross-checked against the
  `login_hint`. The plugin trusts the token because it comes straight from the
  OP over a client-authenticated TLS poll — it does not independently verify
  the JWT signature. That trust therefore rests on the token endpoint being
  reached over correctly configured TLS with client authentication; deploy
  accordingly (always `https://`, real client credentials) and do not point a
  CIBA handler at a plaintext or unauthenticated endpoint outside local
  development.
- Sufficiency is the runtime's job. Keycloak has no RFC 9396 rich
  authorization request, so the binding between "what was approved" and "what is
  being executed" lives in APL: the `scope:` expression is evaluated against the
  live request args at validation. A human can approve, but if the args drift
  outside `scope` (e.g. the amount was raised after approval), the operation
  fails closed regardless.

The `purpose` is recorded verbatim as the source of truth for what was approved
— it is never derived from model output.

## Pipeline integration

`require_approval(...)` and its sibling verbs dispatch to a plugin implementing
the `elicit` hook, resolved by name off the route's dispatch plan exactly like
`delegate(...)`. Because elicitation is an explicit, sequenced effect — gated
behind authentication, checked on every retry, and validated before the forward
— a pending or unapproved operation never reaches the tool.
