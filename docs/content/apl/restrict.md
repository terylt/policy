# Backend Restriction

Some controls are not about *whether* an operation runs, but *where* it runs.
"EU customer data must be inferred on EU backends." "This tenant may only use
the cheap model tier." The agent asks for a class of backend — "inference" —
and policy shapes which concrete backends are eligible. That shaping is the
`restrict` effect.

`restrict` declares a predicate over backend attributes, narrowing the set of
backends the host's router may select from. It never picks a backend and never
allows or denies the request — the router still chooses the best survivor by
health and load. Like `taint`, it is an accumulating effect: every
`restrict` that fires only ever *narrows* the set, and multiple restrictions
compose by conjunction.

## What `restrict` is not

`restrict` is not an access-control verb. "May I use this *named* backend?" is a
`require` / `deny`. `restrict` only shapes a set the router chooses from.

| Situation | Verb |
|-----------|------|
| The agent named a specific target ("model `gpt-4o`", "tool X at site A") | `require` / `deny` |
| The agent asked for a class ("inference"); policy shapes which backends are eligible | `restrict` |

## Residency requirement

A tenant is EU-resident: its data must stay in-region. When the agent runs
inference on that tenant's data, only EU inference backends are eligible — and
if none are reachable, the request must fail rather than silently spill to a US
backend. The agent never named a backend; it asked for "inference." The control
must live in routing, not in the prompt.

## Declaring a restriction

The session is marked when EU-resident data is read (see [Session
Taint](tainting.md)); a later inference route restricts routing to EU
backends when that label is present. Whether the caller's tenant is EU-resident
is an operator-maintained fact, looked up from the [`data.*` static
attributes](attributes.md):

```yaml
routes:
  # Reading data for an EU-resident tenant marks the session.
  - tool: fetch_customer
    authorization:
      post_invocation:
        - when: "data.tenants[subject.tenant].data_region == 'eu'"
          do:
            - "taint(eu_resident, session)"

  # Later inference is pinned to EU backends while that label is set.
  - llm: "*"
    authorization:
      pre_invocation:
        - when: "security.labels contains 'eu_resident'"
          do:
            - restrict:
                allow_regions: [eu]
                on_empty: deny        # fail closed, never leave the region
```

`data.tenants[subject.tenant].data_region` indexes the tenant→region map by
*this caller's* tenant; when it is `eu`, the session is tainted, and the
inference route then narrows the candidate set to backends whose `region` label
is `eu`. The router load-balances across the healthy EU backends.

## The constraint fields

A restriction is a small set of typed fields plus a `custom` label map. The
shape is deliberately simple — it is a contract the host router evaluates
against each backend's labels, not a predicate language.

| Field | Backend attribute | Match |
|-------|-------------------|-------|
| `allow_models` | `model` must be in the set | glob (`anthropic/claude-sonnet-*`) |
| `deny_models` | `model` must not be in the set | glob |
| `allow_regions` | `region` must be in the set | equality |
| `allow_sites` | `site` must be in the set | equality |
| `max_cost_tier` | `cost_tier` must be at or below the tier | ordered tiers |
| `custom` | backend must carry every label | equality (like a k8s `nodeSelector`) |
| `on_empty` | what to do when nothing is eligible | `deny` (default) or `fallback` |

`custom` is the escape hatch for backend attributes without a typed field:
`custom: { gpu: h100 }` keeps only backends labelled `gpu=h100`. Unset fields
place no constraint.

## Per-caller values from the attribute tree

The set-valued fields (`allow_models`, `deny_models`, `allow_regions`,
`allow_sites`) take either a literal list *or* a `data.*` reference into the
[static attribute tree](attributes.md) — resolved per request. This lets one
rule serve every caller instead of hard-coding a block per agent or tenant:

<!-- validate: attributes -->
```yaml
# attributes/agents.yaml
data:
  agents:
    support-bot:  { allowed_models: ["vllm/*"] }
    research-bot: { allowed_models: ["anthropic/*", "vllm/*"] }
```

```yaml
routes:
  - llm: "*"
    authorization:
      pre_invocation:
        # allow_models is looked up from the tree by the caller's id.
        - restrict:
            allow_models: "data.agents[subject.id].allowed_models"
```

`support-bot` is restricted to `vllm/*`, `research-bot` to `anthropic/*` +
`vllm/*` — one rule, values maintained in config. The distinction is by YAML
shape: a list is a literal set; a bare scalar is a reference. Quote a
reference that contains `[...]` (as above) so YAML doesn't read the brackets as
an inline list.

If the referenced path doesn't resolve — an agent absent from the tree, a
missing `subject.id` — the field resolves to the empty set: nothing
qualifies, so `on_empty` decides (deny by default). An unknown caller is never
silently unconstrained. (`max_cost_tier` and `custom` are literal-only.)

## Gating happens at the composition layer

`restrict` has no `when:` field of its own. Whether it fires is handled by APL's
normal effect-gating — a `when:`/`do:` rule — like every other effect.
This keeps `restrict` orthogonal: it is *only* a set of backend constraints, and
*whether* it applies is a normal predicate. The two layers remain separate: the
`when:` gate is evaluated now, in PPE, against the request; the constraint
fields are evaluated later, by the host router, against its backends.

Because it is accumulating, `restrict` composes anywhere an effect can appear —
top-level, inside a `when` body, inside `sequential` / `parallel`, and inside a
PDP's `on_allow` block. That last one is a first-class pattern: let Cedar make
the fine-grained decision, then pin routing on allow.

<!-- validate: phase-list -->
```yaml
- cedar:
    action: 'Action::"read"'
    resource: { type: Dataset, id: eu_data }
    on_allow:
      - restrict: { allow_regions: [eu] }   # authz says yes → now pin routing to EU
```

## How a restriction reaches the router

Multiple `restrict` effects in one request fold into a single constraint:
allow-sets intersect, deny-sets and `custom` grow, tier ceilings combine, and
`on_empty` takes the strictest. The result rides out on the typed
`candidate_constraint` extension (see [Extensions](../extensions.md)) — the same
in-process channel minted delegation tokens use, not a request header.

The host router evaluates it. PPE has no backend list and no live health, so it
cannot run the match itself; it emits the constraint and the router — which owns
the health-aware backend registry — checks each candidate's labels against it at
selection time.

  RT -->|none eligible| OE{"on_empty"}
  OE -->|deny| DENY["fail closed"]
  OE -->|fallback| ALL["unconstrained set"]
```

## Failing closed

`on_empty` decides what happens when a restriction prunes every candidate. Only
the router knows which backends are actually reachable, so the choice rides out
with the constraint:

- `deny` (default) rejects the request. Correct for hard constraints like
  data sovereignty — never silently escape the region.
- `fallback` reverts to the unconstrained set. An explicit opt-in for
  "prefer, but don't fail."

## Pipeline integration

`restrict` is an effect like any other: it sequences with `require`, PDP calls,
and `taint` (see [Effects](effects.md)), and its gate is an ordinary predicate.
The control uses the same PPE-owned state as Session Taint. The decision is
assembled inside PPE and handed to the router as a typed
constraint, so the untrusted model cannot reword its way onto a backend that
policy excluded. The clean split of ownership is the point: which backends exist
and their health belong to the host; *which of them this request may use* is
policy's to shape.
