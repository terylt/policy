Policy engine for [Praxis](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/praxis), covering
both standard policy use cases as well as AI inference and agents.

A typed, phased plugin runtime and policy evaluator for agent traffic. It decides
who may call which tool, what data comes back, and where that data is allowed to
go next.

## What it does

- **Identity**: Resolves and independently validates user, agent, and workload
  identities.
- **Authorization**: Evaluates APL predicates and pluggable decision points,
  including relationship-based authorization.
- **Delegation**: Exchanges credentials through RFC 8693, giving each upstream
  service a token scoped to that service.
- **Data control**: Redacts fields in transit, propagates Session Taint across
  tool calls and requests, and filters what an upstream is allowed to tell a
  client back.
- **Out-of-band approval**: Supports out-of-band approval and elicitation.
- **Audit**: Emits an audit event for every decision.

## Using it

Add one dependency to get the engine and all bundled extensions:

```toml
praxis-policy = { version = "0.2", features = ["builtins"] }
```

Without `builtins`, you get the engine alone and no extensions compiled in.
Declare individual features instead: `jwt`, `oauth`, `elicitation-ciba`,
`cedar`, `cel`, `opa`, `valkey`.

The crates are versioned together and released together, so a single `0.2`
requirement covers the set. Requires Rust 1.96 or newer.

## Status

The public API will move between minor versions while the shape settles;
a breaking change gets a minor bump and is documented in the CHANGELOG.

## Layout

    crates/             the engine, APL implementation, and host facade
    builtins/           bundled plugins, decision points, and session stores
    reference/          worked examples, not published and not bundled

A host may replace any bundled plugin. Implement a Plugin Factory through
`PluginFactory` against `praxis_policy_core::prelude`, then register it with
`PolicyEngine::register_factory` under the `kind:` your policy names. An
unrecognized `kind` causes policy loading to fail, so missing registrations are
detected at startup.

`reference/plugins/` holds two worked examples: a PII scanner and an audit
logger. These are not published, but are linted and tested here, and the
reference [demo](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/demos) registers them as host
plugins.

## Building

The toolchain is pinned and is also the MSRV, so `cargo build` picks the right
one. `make help` lists the available targets.
